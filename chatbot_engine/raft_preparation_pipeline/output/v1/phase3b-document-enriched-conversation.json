Before you can feel anger, you must necessarily make the interpretation you are entitled to get what you want in this situation. Consequently, you see the goof-up on your reservation as an injustice.

Many times I have watched a person's anger heighten rapidly until it reached its limit, broke away, and left the person shaking and crying as the fear, which lay beneath, surfaced.

          "result. People back away from the person who expresses anger. Relationships don't become deeper or closer. On the contrary, the involved people separate further. Despite this realization, I had two reasons for continuing to encourage people to express anger freely. Anger is a feeling, and I believe that the sharing of feelings leads to more substantial relationships. I also had bought into the \"reservoir theory\": a person doesn't let anger out, but carries it around, adding new supplies each time anger occurs and remains unexpressed; eventually it overflows in the form of an aggressive, violent explosion. Ventilation lowers the level of the reservoir and averts violence. In 1980, when I was asked to train professionals to help angry clients, I researched the subject. I wanted to back up my theories with other professionals' techniques and the results from studies. As I read over a hundred articles, research studies, and books, I found that many counseling professionals held beliefs similar to my own and were acting accordingly. But the research didn't always support our practices. Below is a synopsis of information",

It was not her angry feeling that worried me, but the behavior that she might use to express that anger had me on edge. That principle applies to anyone's anger. It is not the emotion that is destructive, but the way a person expresses it. Since my boss is not a vindictive person, my anxiety over a lost job had little to do with her and much more to do with memy fears and my learned expectations. Once I could put those to rest with more accurate in- Page 96 formation, I was free to make a decision based on my priorities and not on potential,"

Take a careful look at these interpretations because anger can be a two-edged sword. The consequences of an im- pulsive outburst will frequently defeat you in the long run. Even if you are being genuinely wronged, it may not be to your advantage to feel angry about it. The pain and suffering you inflict on yourself by feeling outraged may far exceed the impact of the original insult. As a woman who runs a restaurant put it, ‘‘Sure—I have the right to fly off the handle. The other day I realized the chefs forgot to order ham again even though I had specifically reminded them, so I exploded and threw a cauldron of hot soup across the kitchen floor in disgust. Two minutes later [ knew I’d acted like the biggest asshole in the world, but I didn’t want to admit",
          "simply defeat me? Example: You are playing basketball, and a fellow on the other team elbows you in the stomach intentionally so as to upset you and get you off your game. You may be able to channel your anger productively so you will play harder and win. So far your anger is adaptive.* Once the game Is over, you may no longer want that anger. Now it’s maladaptive. Suppose your three-year-old son runs mindlessly into the street and risks his life. In this case he 1s not intentionally inflicting harm. Nevertheless, the angry mode in which you express yourself may be adaptive. The emotional arousal in your voice conveys a message of alarm and importance that might not come across if you were to deal with him in a calm, totally objective manner. In both these examples, you chose to be angry, and the magnitude and expression of the emotion were under your control. The adaptive and positive effects of your anger differentiate it from hostility, which is impulsive and uncontrolled and leads to aggression. Suppose you are enraged"

Steve came back the next week and said he had lost the manuscript before having a chance to read it.

What problem in your life is so terrible that there is no solution?’’ Then I would help that person expose the illogical thinking that lurks behind the suicidal impulse as quickly as possible. When you begin to think more real- istically, your sense of hopelessness and the desire to end your life will fade away and you will have the urge to live. Thus, I recommend joy rather than death to suicidal indi- viduals, and I try to show them how to achieve it as fast as possible! Let’s see how this can be done. Holly was a nineteen-year-old woman who was referred to me for treatment by a child psychoanalyst in New York City. He had treated her unsuccessfully with analytic therapy for many years since the onset of a severe unremitting depression in her early teens. Other doctors had also been unable",
          "attempt. This point of view 1s unwarranted. You are more likely to feel a great sense of relief in dis- cussing suicidal thoughts with a professional therapist, and consequently you have a much better chance of defusing them. If you do have suicidal thoughts, ask yourself if you are taking such thoughts seriously. Are there times when you wish you were dead? If the answer is yes, is your death wish active or passive? A passive death wish exists if you would prefer to be dead, but you are unwilling to take active steps to bring this about. One young man confessed to me, “Doctor, every night when I go to bed I pray to God to let FEELING GOOD 387 me wake up with cancer. Then I could die in peace, and my family would understand. ’’ An active death wish is more dangerous. If you are se- riously planning an actual suicide attempt, then it’s impor- tant to know the following: Have you thought about a method? What is your method? Have you made plans?

I, after all, had been dangerously suicidal myself on several occasions since our Bistro Gardens compact and certainly had not called him. Nor had I even thought of calling. Suicide is not beholden to an evening’s promises, nor does it always hearken to plans drawn up in lucid moments and banked in good intentions. I know this for an unfortunate fact. Suicide has been a professional interest of mine for more than twenty years, and a very personal one for considerably longer. I have a hard-earned respect for suicide’s ability to undermine, overwhelm, outwit, devastate, and destroy. As a clinician, researcher, and teacher I have known or consulted on patients who hanged, shot, or asphyxiated themselves; jumped to their deaths from stairwells, buildings, or overpasses; died from poisons, fumes, prescription drugs; or slashed their wrists or cut their throats. Close friends, fellow students from graduate school, colleagues, and children of colleagues have done similar or the same. Most were",

The peak months for suicide were, with rare exceptions, in the late spring and summer. Likewise, the lowest rates were always found in the winter months. This late-spring-to-summer peak has also been found in a series of Belgian, Finnish, American, and Chinese studies completed since the time of the review. Seasonal variation in suicide appears to correlate not with the dark and dismal months but with the brightness and extended duration of spring and summer light instead. Consistent with this, studies carried out in the Southern Hemisphere—in Australia, Chile, Uruguay, and South Africa—show that suicide peaks in the months making up their springs and summers. In the Northern Hemisphere, men have one peak in suicide—in April, May, and the summer months—whereas women appear to share that peak but to have a second smaller one in October and November as well. 15 a England 14 1485-1715 A Europe 13 1840-1876 England ~~-O-—\" 1865-1884 15 World Health —e— Organization countries 1951-1959 United"

Sometimes - for example when we've drunk alcohol or taken drugs, or sometimes even when we haven't - the way our brain is functioning can affect our judgement. But in each case, we are actively making sense of our world. Recent research into ‘psychotic’ experiences has found that often this sense-making or interpretation of events (‘cognitive factors’ in technical language) can play an important role. Unusual beliefs (‘delusions’) are very similar to other beliefs or prejudices. Many ‘normal’ beliefs involve a resistance to change and a bias towards evidence that confirms one's initial suspicions.® An example might be a football supporter who sees one win as confirmation that his or her team is the best, despite a long run of lost matches. We can probably all think of friends or family members who hold on to particular beliefs despite - as we see it anyway - all the evidence. Understanding Psychosis 47 There is a vigorous debate over what might lead to someone developing a particular ‘delusional’",

          "overwhelming emotion. The way we make sense of things and reach conclusions is also affected by our emotions. When we are feeling stressed, anxious, depressed or overwhelmed, the ways that we think about the world and ourselves change. We become more self-conscious, more self-critical, and more aware of risks and dangers. If we suspect that people are trying to harm us, or worry that the voices we hear can do bad things, we are likely to be more easily convinced when we are ina negative emotional state. And, of course, these links work the other way round as well. If you are hearing voices threatening to do bad things, you are quite likely to be anxious, suspicious and perhaps depressed. This close relationship with emotions means that anything that helps with emotional problems (for example, dealing with sources of stress, or perhaps psychological therapy focused on anxiety or depression) can also help with psychosis.”’ Similarly, if someone is experiencing a crisis where their experiences are overwhelming, anything that can help them feel calmer (kind, reassuring words, for example, or good",

This tends to happen more if we are 46 Division of Clinical Psychology tired, stressed or upset. Most of us also experience an ‘inner voice’ when thinking in words, for example, when deciding what to do, struggling with a problem, or reading. Evidence that for some people voice hearing is linked with ‘inner speech’ comes from brain scanning experiments which show that speech areas in the brain are often active when people hear voices.* Other psychological experiments show that some people who hear voices can experience difficulty distinguishing between their thoughts and words spoken to them.’ This blurring of the distinction between inner and outer speech might be part of the reason that some people hear voices more often than others. Voices are also often related to memories. For example, someone might hear the voice of someone who abused or criticised them in the past, and indeed voices can sometimes take",
          "help. Traditionally, the framework within which help has been offered has been a medical one, and the experiences have been seen as symptoms of mental illnesses, for example schizophrenia. People often assume that mental illnesses ‘exist’ in the same way that broken bones exist and can be revealed by medical tests in the same way. However, there are many different theories as to what causes experiences such as hearing voices. The idea that they are symptoms of illness, perhaps caused by some sort of chemical imbalance or other problem in the brain, is just one of the theories. There is no objective biological test such as a blood test or scan for diagnosing mental illness. There is a vigorous debate about whether it is meaningful or useful to think of these experiences as symptoms of mental illnesses. The main issues that are debated are: e The extent to which psychotic experiences can be separated from normal ones e The frequency with which ‘normal’ as well as ‘ill’ people experience these things e The extent to which clinicians can agree on"

          "overwhelming emotion. The way we make sense of things and reach conclusions is also affected by our emotions. When we are feeling stressed, anxious, depressed or overwhelmed, the ways that we think about the world and ourselves change. We become more self-conscious, more self-critical, and more aware of risks and dangers. If we suspect that people are trying to harm us, or worry that the voices we hear can do bad things, we are likely to be more easily convinced when we are ina negative emotional state. And, of course, these links work the other way round as well. If you are hearing voices threatening to do bad things, you are quite likely to be anxious, suspicious and perhaps depressed. This close relationship with emotions means that anything that helps with emotional problems (for example, dealing with sources of stress, or perhaps psychological therapy focused on anxiety or depression) can also help with psychosis.”’ Similarly, if someone is experiencing a crisis where their experiences are overwhelming, anything that can help them feel calmer (kind, reassuring words, for example, or good"

If you are like most people, you started drinking for one of three reasons: ¢ Alcohol or drugs made you feel really good. ¢ They helped you to feel better when you were not feeling well (for example, when you were in physical pain or discomfort, or when you were experienc- ing negative emotions such as sadness, anxiety, or anger). ¢ They enhanced your performance at something (for example, sports or the ability to work long hours without getting tired). If you were seeking the good, pleasurable feelings, or the performance enhance- ment, then your motivation was for what is known as positive reinforcement. If you were trying to alleviate physical or emotional pain, then you were “self-medicating” with alcohol or drugs. (This is also called negative reinforcement because you are drinking or using to “take away” something unpleasant, like pain.) Regardless of the reason you were drawn to alcohol or drugs, in the beginning, it worked. You",

As long as I get right back on the road to recovery, without wasting any more time drinking or using, I will feel good about myself again very soon. Another important thing to remember is to catch yourself if you find that you are getting into the spiraling lapse mindset. In chapter 5, we discussed how sometimes when you experience a slip or a lapse, it can trigger dysfunctional thoughts like, I’ve blown it. I'm a total failure. I'll never stay sober. I have nothing to lose by continuing to drink (or use). Beware of the spiraling lapse frame of mind; it is a sure pathway from a slip to a full-blown relapse. You can avoid it by recognizing it for what it is, and intentionally bringing your thoughts into a more CBT-oriented mindset, in which you view the slip as a learning opportunity that",

And this is what kept the pattern going: the more these expectations of elation, relax- ation, happiness, confidence, relief, or any other sensation you were seeking were fulfilled, the more you wanted to drink or use drugs.

The same goes for other uncomfortable emotions, such as sadness, grief, anxiety, or anger. When you try to run away from these feelings, they usually come back stronger. A key aspect of practicing mindfulness is learning to accept that discomfort is there, while rec- ognizing at the same time that your actions don’t have to be dictated by your natural desire to get rid of it. Here are a few things you can tell yourself to practice acceptance: * It’s okay for me to see things just as they are right now, as opposed to the way I think they should be. * Just because I accept the way that I am feeling right now, it doesn’t mean that I am satisfied",

You may recall that in chapter 2, you learned about how your use of alcohol or drugs can become a conditioned, automatic response to certain cues, much like a habit. When drinking or using drugs becomes associated, or “linked,” with certain situations, emotions, people, or things, then those become triggers. Because that psy- chological link between triggers and using substances can be very powerful, being in the presence of these triggers can become quite uncomfortable without alcohol or drugs. You'll experience this discomfort as a craving. Studies have shown that triggers fall into several categories (Marlatt and Gordon 1985; Larimer, Palmer, and Marlatt 1999). As you become a self expert, think about which of these categories apply to you, so that you can learn to become more self- aware when you enter triggering situations: * Negative emotional states: Some people drink or use drugs as a way of “self-medicating” uncomfortable emotions such as anxiety, sadness, boredom,",

Now, those things themselves, because of the strong associa- tion in your mind between them and using pot, can trigger very strong urges to get high. For someone who has just stopped smoking pot, opening a drawer and finding a pipe in it can create a powerful craving. For this reason, getting all of that stuff out of your immediate environment (your home, backpack, purse, car, or anywhere else you keep it) is one of the very first steps you will need to take to prevent a slip or a relapse.

That experience includes what you think about the trigger and how it feels to want to neutralize it. When we skip over this middle part, however, we miss the opportunity to interfere in the obsessive-compulsive cycle. If we are mindful, by which I mean if we can stay present with the trigger, our experience of it, and the urge to do compulsions, then there is an opportunity to stand up to the OCD. Understanding What a Mind Does Consider that your mind is just whatever it is that you look through in order to see what’s going on inside the brain. Your mind is like a flashlight that you point at different territories in a landscape made up of ideas, emotions, and sensations. You can have any kind of thought that is available to be had, and when you say you are having a particular thought, you mean you are shining the light on this idea in this present moment.",

The problem is that you mistake the simple awareness of this thought for having an intrinsic meaning, instead of just being a mental event that comes with having an OCD mind. Therefore mindfulness, the skill of observing mental events without judgment or analysis, is an essential aspect of mastering the disorder. The brain records actions much more clearly than thoughts, feelings, or intentions. What this means is that the parent who changes the child’s diaper while having intrusive thoughts about committing some vile act in the process is actually recording more helpful information than the parent who is avoiding changing the diaper and the intrusive thoughts. The person who allows the thoughts but not the avoidance is actually programming the brain to perceive the thoughts as irrelevant and the value of the interaction as the most important element. The avoidant person is establishing only that diaper-changing is a threat. One way to keep this concept in mind is",

But because you know you're not in harm’s way on this side of the glass, you allow yourself to be disturbed. You also allow yourself to notice their beauty, the way they move, the different shapes they come in, and so on. They are more than just the thoughts and feelings they elicit. Having OCD feels a lot like being in a shark tank with the sharks. When you see a shark coming at you, you don’t just tread water and observe it. You scramble to get away. Your thoughts, like sharks, seem like they can destroy you. Mindfulness means remembering that you are not in the shark tank—you are in the aquarium. The shark may still be disturbing, but you allow the disturbance to come and go. When we are mindful, the harm thoughts"

The OCD wants one thing only, to dominate your attention so that you engage in compulsions.

If you are carrying around a thought process like I should never have violent thoughts and then you become aware of a violent thought, you may feel the urge to drop whatever you were doing before the thought popped up and start ritualizing.

Given the content of these types of obsessions, one might assume they only occur to adults, but in fact taboo themes of violence, sex, and religious sacrilege frequently come up in pediatric OCD (Masi et al. 2005). Aggressive obsessions may range in prevalence from 32.6-75% of children with OCD (Storch et al. 2008).

Given the content of these types of obsessions, one might assume they only occur to adults, but in fact taboo themes of violence, sex, and religious sacrilege frequently come up in pediatric OCD (Masi et al. 2005). Aggressive obsessions may range in prevalence from 32.6-75% of children with OCD (Storch et al. 2008).

Sometimes - for example when we've drunk alcohol or taken drugs, or sometimes even when we haven't - the way our brain is functioning can affect our judgement. But in each case, we are actively making sense of our world. Recent research into ‘psychotic’ experiences has found that often this sense-making or interpretation of events (‘cognitive factors’ in technical language) can play an important role. Unusual beliefs (‘delusions’) are very similar to other beliefs or prejudices. Many ‘normal’ beliefs involve a resistance to change and a bias towards evidence that confirms one's initial suspicions.® An example might be a football supporter who sees one win as confirmation that his or her team is the best, despite a long run of lost matches. We can probably all think of friends or family members who hold on to particular beliefs despite - as we see it anyway - all the evidence. Understanding Psychosis 47 There is a vigorous debate over what might lead to someone developing a particular ‘delusional’",

However, there are many different theories as to what causes experiences such as hearing voices. The idea that they are symptoms of illness, perhaps caused by some sort of chemical imbalance or other problem in the brain, is just one of the theories. There is no objective biological test such as a blood test or scan for diagnosing mental illness. There is a vigorous debate about whether it is meaningful or useful to think of these experiences as symptoms of mental illnesses.

As we explain below, the idea that these experiences are symptoms of mental illnesses is a controversial one. Nevertheless, until recently much research published in academic journals was based on this assumption, and so the only estimates available tend to be numbers of people who have received a certain diagnosis. The past decade, however (since, indeed, the publication of our first report),' has seen a steady increase in research exploring individual experiences such as hearing voices.’ Researchers have also discovered that many people will not be counted in any figures because they do not find their experiences distressing and therefore do not seek help from mental health professionals.* However, much research still relies on psychiatric diagnoses given to people who come into contact with services.

          "disorder is that many parts have serious cognitive distortions (Ross, 1989, 1997). Typically parts of you living in trauma-time have severe cognitive errors. These influence your life in confusing ways, because not all parts of you may think in the same way. Following are several commonly identified cognitive errors (Beck, 1975; Burns, 1999). * All-or-nothing thinking. You, or parts of yourself, perceive everything as either black or white, yes or no, either/or. Things are either good or bad; there is no middle ground. Anything that is less than perfect is a disaster. People either like you or hate you; they are kind or cruel; honest or completely dishonest. If they ever say “no” to you, they have permanently rejected you. This pattern leaves no room for balance, nuance, or human frailties. * Overgeneralizing. You, or parts of yourself, assume that one experience generalizes to all others, so that once you have had a bad experience, you believe that every similar situation going forward will also be negative. For instance, you ask someone out to see a movie, but she cannot",
          "example: The green color on the wall is the same as in the past, but the wall, the room, the house, the city, the year, and even I am not the same as in the past. The only similarity is green, only paint. I am not there, I am here. I can see the pictures on the wall that are different than in the past. The carpet on the floor is different. When I look out the window, I see the scenery of the present, which is different from the past. This green wall reminded me of something that I am not yet ready to handle. I will put that memory in a safe place and contain it until I am ready. This repetition gradually helps all parts to notice these differences, instead of only focusing on what is similar to the past. It is particularly important to pay attention to differences when a person in the present reminds you of someone from the past with whom you felt uncomfortable or unsafe. For example, if a friend becomes irritated with",

This reaction is based on a feedback loop consisting of the following: ¢ Perceptions (seeing her walk past without greeting you; her eyes straight ahead) * Thoughts (“She doesn’t like me. I’m such a loser.””) ¢ Emotions (shame, hurt, anger) ¢ Sensations (roiling in the pit of your stomach, flushed face) ¢ Movements (hunched shoulders, downcast eyes, urge to run away and disappear) * Predictions (“No one will ever like me; things will always end badly for me.”’) ¢ Decision making (“From now on I will avoid people. I’d rather be by myself.’’) ¢ Actions (isolation, avoiding phone calls from people, turning down requests to do things with others) You can see how these experiences are"

The problem is that you mistake the simple awareness of this thought for having an intrinsic meaning, instead of just being a mental event that comes with having an OCD mind. Therefore mindfulness, the skill of observing mental events without judgment or analysis, is an essential aspect of mastering the disorder. The brain records actions much more clearly than thoughts, feelings, or intentions. What this means is that the parent who changes the child’s diaper while having intrusive thoughts about committing some vile act in the process is actually recording more helpful information than the parent who is avoiding changing the diaper and the intrusive thoughts. The person who allows the thoughts but not the avoidance is actually programming the brain to perceive the thoughts as irrelevant and the value of the interaction as the most important element.

You also allow yourself to notice their beauty, the way they move, the different shapes they come in, and so on. They are more than just the thoughts and feelings they elicit. Having OCD feels a lot like being in a shark tank with the sharks. When you see a shark coming at you, you don’t just tread water and observe it. You scramble to get away. Your thoughts, like sharks, seem like they can destroy you. Mindfulness means remembering that you are not in the shark tank—you are in the aquarium.

For example, allowing yourself to have scary thoughts while using a knife to peel an apple in the same room as a loved one may feel immoral, as if you were using this innocent person as a guinea pig in a sick experiment.

People may think often about death or suicide. Depression is diagnosed when at least five of a group of symptoms have lasted for at least two weeks. Electroconvulsive therapy (Ecr): A treatment procedure for severe depression and severe mania. EcT involves passing a controlled electric current between two metal discs applied on the surface of the scalp. Episode: A period of illness. This can include depression, hypo- mania, mania or a mixed state. Group therapy: Therapy for a number of patients together.

          "Sleep disturbance is common in depression. Many people suffer from insomnia: they have trouble falling asleep, wake up often during the night or wake very early in the morning. People do not see sleep as being restful, and they may wake up feeling exhausted. Other people oversleep, especially during the day; they are said to have “hypersomnia.” Apathy or agitation: Many people with depression develop slowed- down movement, speech or thinking. In severe cases, people with depression may be unable to move, speak and respond to their environment. For some people, the opposite happens, and they are very agitated. They are tormented by a severe inner restless- ness—they cannot sit still, they pace, they may wring their hands. They may also show their agitation in other ways. People who feel agitated often feel very anxious, too. Loss of energy: People experiencing depression find it hard to com- plete everyday chores. It takes them longer to perform at work or at home because they lack energy and drive. The symptoms of bipolar disorder Worthlessness and guilt: When depressed, people may lack"

Walk in their shoes for moment and feel empathy for how difficult it is. Be aware that you are all struggling so hard, each in your own way, and have your own suffering and needs.

As soon as your boss approaches, even before he or she says anything, a child part of you is convinced that you are in trouble and you feel yourself freezing. A critical voice berates the younger part for being afraid, and it is ready to be aggressive with your idiotic boss. You are already primed for action, but it is action based on flight or fight, not on being present and assertive. Your boss then asks you to work over the weekend. The younger part immediately wants to say, “Yes, I’1l be glad to” so as not to anger the boss, relieved that she is not in trouble yet, but still afraid."

Sometimes - for example when we've drunk alcohol or taken drugs, or sometimes even when we haven't - the way our brain is functioning can affect our judgement. But in each case, we are actively making sense of our world. Recent research into ‘psychotic’ experiences has found that often this sense-making or interpretation of events (‘cognitive factors’ in technical language) can play an important role. Unusual beliefs (‘delusions’) are very similar to other beliefs or prejudices. Many ‘normal’ beliefs involve a resistance to change and a bias towards evidence that confirms one's initial suspicions.® An example might be a football supporter who sees one win as confirmation that his or her team is the best, despite a long run of lost matches. We can probably all think of friends or family members who hold on to particular beliefs despite - as we see it anyway - all the evidence.

Common diagnoses given to people who have these sorts of experiences are schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.

          "help. Traditionally, the framework within which help has been offered has been a medical one, and the experiences have been seen as symptoms of mental illnesses, for example schizophrenia. People often assume that mental illnesses ‘exist’ in the same way that broken bones exist and can be revealed by medical tests in the same way. However, there are many different theories as to what causes experiences such as hearing voices. The idea that they are symptoms of illness, perhaps caused by some sort of chemical imbalance or other problem in the brain, is just one of the theories. There is no objective biological test such as a blood test or scan for diagnosing mental illness. There is a vigorous debate about whether it is meaningful or useful to think of these experiences as symptoms of mental illnesses. The main issues that are debated are: e The extent to which psychotic experiences can be separated from normal ones e The frequency with which ‘normal’ as well as ‘ill’ people experience these things e The extent to which clinicians can agree on",

For example, cultures and subcultures vary with regard to whether particular experiences are seen as signs of mental illness, as normal (religious and spiritual beliefs, for example), or even as revered spiritual gifts (such as in the case of shamans).\"* These findings suggest that although"

Most of us also experience an ‘inner voice’ when thinking in words, for example, when deciding what to do, struggling with a problem, or reading. Evidence that for some people voice hearing is linked with ‘inner speech’ comes from brain scanning experiments which show that speech areas in the brain are often active when people hear voices.* Other psychological experiments show that some people who hear voices can experience difficulty distinguishing between their thoughts and words spoken to them.’ This blurring of the distinction between inner and outer speech might be part of the reason that some people hear voices more often than others. Voices are also often related to memories. For example, someone might hear the voice of someone who abused or criticised them in the past, and indeed voices can sometimes take"

When we are feeling stressed, anxious, depressed or overwhelmed, the ways that we think about the world and ourselves change.

The victim posture, the role taken by someone who sees self as emotional prey for others, is a direct result of misplacing responsibility for angry feelings. This individual focuses more on blaming others to channel the anger, or on changing others to reduce the anger, than on using the anger for protection and assertion of self. Accepting responsibility for another's anger is also victimizing. Someone whose attention and effort are focused on others' feelings hasn't the energy to spend on personal wants and needs. As Figure C illustrates, a person who experiences these problems is emotionally isolated from self and others. Deprived of the feelings information valuable to effective daily functioning, he cannot know how to express or respond to the masked emotions when they do surface.

One of my experiences shows how people can fail to communicate. Somehow I have learned that \"excited\" means sexually aroused. I was working in an outpatient clinic on an especially hard day when my last client arrived. He was a sixty-seven-year-old man, balding and toothless. He wore a dirty coat and appeared not to have had a bath in quite a while. As I was confronting him about some of his inappropriate behaviors, he turned to me and said, \"Lorrainne, you're getting me excited.\" My immediate thought was, \"It's too late in the day to deal with this kind of thing.\" I still thank God that I asked my client for clarification and didn't respond according to my assumption about the meaning of \"excited.\" What he was trying to tell me",

The same goes for other uncomfortable emotions, such as sadness, grief, anxiety, or anger. When you try to run away from these feelings, they usually come back stronger.

First, let’s look at an example. Carrie Considers Change Carrie has been smoking pot on a daily basis for the past eight years. In general, she’s been very functional for most of that time. She’s held down a few different jobs as a production assistant in the television industry, she’s had a long-term relationship (which she recently ended), and she has kept up a pretty active social life. Lately she’s been noticing that she has a lot of anxiety. She has found herself obsessing about past decisions (such as breaking up with her most recent boyfriend), and questioning whether they were right or wrong. She has also noticed that she’s been thinking a lot about her career and wondering why she hasn't really advanced rom the level of assistant to something a little higher up. These thoughts have had a depressive effect, leading her to smoke"

Rolling papers, bongs, and pipes are examples of the different types of things that helped you to use. Now, those things themselves, because of the strong associa- tion in your mind between them and using pot, can trigger very strong urges to get high. For someone who has just stopped smoking pot, opening a drawer and finding a pipe in it can create a powerful craving. For this reason, getting all of that stuff out of your immediate environment (your home, backpack, purse, car, or anywhere else you keep it) is one of the very first steps you will need to take to prevent a slip or a relapse. If your preferred substance is alcohol, then you might need to get your favor- ite wine glass or shot glass out of your home.

The learned asso- ciation between the sound of the bell and the experience of eating was so strong that the dog developed what is called a conditioned response to the bell. Salivating is a con- ditioned response that is designed to prepare the body to eat. In the same way that Pavlov’s dog learned that the bell was a cue that signaled that food was coming, people can “learn” addictive behaviors. When you drink or use drugs frequently around certain people or in certain places, you learn to associate those people or places with the experience of being high or intoxicated. People and places become “cues” just like the bell in Pavlov’s experiments. These cues create an anticipation of drinking or using drugs and all of the feelings that go along with being intoxicated or high. That anticipation can create an intense urge or craving. Emotions can become cues as well; when you drink or use drugs repeatedly when you are in a certain emotional state (for example, when you are",

          "it is a fallacy to assume that anxiety disorders are solely (or even primarily) caused by physiological imbalances. The psychological fallacy makes the same kind of mistake in the opposite direction. It assumes that, say, social phobia or generalized anxiety disorder is caused by having grown up with parents who neglected, abandoned, or abused you, resulting in a deep-seated sense of insecurity or shame that causes your current phobic avoidance and anxiety as an adult. While it may be true that your family background contributed in an important way to your current problems, is it reasonable to assume that this is the only cause? Again, not really. To do so overlooks the possible contributions of hereditary and biological factors. After all, not all children who grow up in dysfunctional families develop anxiety disorders. It is more plausible to assume that your problem is a result of both 1) a hereditary predisposition toward anxiety (and possibly phobia) and 2) early childhood conditions that fostered a sense of shame and/or insecurity.

However, if high levels of stress continue, the glands will eventually exhaust themselves again and then remain in a chronic state of underfunctioning. At this stage, they can oscillate between overproducing adrenaline, which can cause panic or mood swings, and underproducing adrenaline. The ultimate outcome of prolonged adrenal fatigue can be chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia, chronic bronchitis or sinusitis, or autoimmune disorders ranging from lupus to rheumatoid arthritis. Symptoms of adrenal fatigue include: ¢ Low stress tolerance (little things that didn’t use to bother you get to you) e Lethargy and fatigue (often manifested in difficulty getting up in the morning) e Light-headedness when standing up quickly (called postural hypotension) ¢ Light sensitivity (difficulty adjusting to bright light outdoors) ¢ Difficulties with concentration and memory ¢ Insomnia ¢ Hypoglycemia e Allergies (to foods, environmental substances, pollens, molds, and so on) ¢ Increased symptoms of premenstrual syndrome ¢ More frequent colds and respiratory conditions Hypoglycemia"

To understand the inner struggles you might have among various parts of yourself, return to the previous example of a boss who asks you to work overtime during the weekend when you already had plans. As soon as your boss approaches, even before he or she says anything, a child part of you is convinced that you are in trouble and you feel yourself freezing. A critical voice berates the younger part for being afraid, and it is ready to be aggressive with your idiotic boss. You are already primed for action, but it is action based on flight or fight, not on being present and assertive. Your boss then asks you to work over the weekend. The younger part immediately wants to say, “Yes, I’1l be glad to” so as not to anger the boss, relieved that she is not in trouble yet, but still afraid."

Done well, in vivo exposure to situations where impulsive acts of harm could do some real damage can be very effective.

Naturally, the presence of harm thoughts can be discomforting and, therefore, you are initially driven to avoid that discomfort. Yet at the same time, when we avoid things, we send a message to the brain that those things are dangerous. To turn this around, we need to interact with the things we feel compelled to avoid and send a message to the brain that these things are not the threats they appear to be.

OCD overall affects roughly 1-2% of children (Rapoport et al. 2000). Children who don’t have OCD are also grappling with new and sometimes frightening concepts every day in multiple environments, so it should come as no surprise that children who do have OCD can be significantly impaired by their OCD symptoms at home, in school, and in their social life (Piacentini et al. 2003). Given the content of these types of obsessions, one might assume they only occur to adults, but in fact taboo themes of violence, sex, and religious sacrilege frequently come up in pediatric OCD (Masi et al. 2005). Aggressive obsessions may range in prevalence from 32.6-75% of children with OCD (Storch et al. 2008).

This can unfortunately lead to nightmarish scenarios wherein people are unnecessarily hospitalized or erroneously reported to an authority as a safety concern. But it is also true that underdiagnosing can lead to other problems, and not just problems of harm.

That’s why you feel so totally down in the dumps. What’s the key to it all? Because depression has been viewed as an emotional disorder throughout the history of psychiatry, therapists from most schools of thought place a strong emphasis on ‘*setting in touch’’ with your feelings.

Every bad feeling you have is the result of your distorted negative thinking. [logical pessimistic attitudes play the central role in the development and continuation of all your symptoms.

          "occasionally patients criticize me for mak- ing a sharp comment that rubs them the wrong way. This criticism usually only hurts my feelings and arouses my guilt if it contains a grain of truth. To the extent that I feel guilty and label myself as “*bad,’’ I tend to react defensively. I have the urge to either deny or justify my error, or to counterattack because that feeling of being a “‘bad person’’ is sO odious. This makes it much more difficult for me to admit and correct the error. If, in contrast, | do not harangue myself or experience any loss of self-respect, it is easy to admit my mistake.

Thus, what ts called for when you do goof up is a process of recognition, learning, and change. Does guilt help you with any of these? I don’t believe it does.

These internal biological clocks respond to environmental cues, primarily light and darkness, to govern when we feel awake and when we feel sleepy. Disruptions to this natural rhythm, such as shift work or irregular sleep schedules, can lead to difficulties with sleep. Understanding the importance of our body's clock allows us to make informed choices that align our habits with our natural tendencies, promoting healthier sleep patterns. By recognizing how the sleep cycle operates, the impact of lifestyle habits, and the significance of circadian rhythms, we can better appreciate the complexities of sleep and how various factors combine to influence our ability to achieve restorative rest.

Involving the police is a painful and difficult decision, although it is sometimes necessary in order to get an ill person to hospital. Family Help for partners and families 49 members often feel overwhelmingly guilty about this decision.

Many ill people who would benefit from hospitaliza- tion do not meet these criteria and therefore may refuse to enter the hospital, or leave the hospital against medical advice. Families usually have a very hard time living with a person with mania who refuses treatment and who cannot be legally hospitalized or kept in hospital. In these situations, try to negotiate with your relative when it might be best to leave the hospital.

However, a person who is severely depressed and suicidal may refuse treatment because he or she feels so hopeless and worthless.

Like many of my colleagues who study suicide, I have seen time and again the limitations of our science, been privileged to see how good some doctors are and appalled by the callousness and incompetence of others. Mostly, I have been impressed by how little value our society puts on saving the lives of those who are in such despair as to want to end them. It is a societal illusion that suicide is rare. It is not. Certainly the mental illnesses most closely tied to suicide are not rare. They are common conditions, and, unlike cancer and heart disease, they disproportionately affect and kill the young. A FEW WEEKS after I nearly died from a suicide attempt, I went to the Episcopal church across the street from the UCLA campus. I was a parishioner there, however occasional, and in light of being able to walk in through the door instead of being carried in by six, I thought I would see what was left of my relationship with God.

I, after all, had been dangerously suicidal myself on several occasions since our Bistro Gardens compact and certainly had not called him. Nor had I even thought of calling. Suicide is not beholden to an evening’s promises, nor does it always hearken to plans drawn up in lucid moments and banked in good intentions. I know this for an unfortunate fact. Suicide has been a professional interest of mine for more than twenty years, and a very personal one for considerably longer. I have a hard-earned respect for suicide’s ability to undermine, overwhelm, outwit, devastate, and destroy. As a clinician, researcher, and teacher I have known or consulted on patients who hanged, shot, or asphyxiated themselves; jumped to their deaths from stairwells, buildings, or overpasses; died from poisons, fumes, prescription drugs; or slashed their wrists or cut their throats.

Most were young and suffered from mental illness; all left behind a wake of unimaginable pain and unresolvable guilt. Like many who have manic-depressive illness, I have also known suicide in a more private, awful way, and I trace the loss of a fundamental innocence to the day that I first considered suicide as the only solution possible to an unendurable level of mental pain. Until that time I had taken for granted, and loved more than I knew, a temperamental lightness of mood and a fabulous expectation of life. I knew death only in the most abstract of senses; I never imagined it would be something to arrange or seek. I was seventeen when, in the midst of my first depression, I became knowledgeable about suicide in something other than an existential, adolescent way.

          "in some detail with psychotherapy and with family education and involvement. Here we delve into what is known about the effectiveness of different kinds of medication in preventing suicide. Suicide usually requires multiple “hits”—a biological predisposition, a major psychiatric illness, and an acute life stress—but only some of these “hits” are amenable to change. There is, for example, relatively little a doctor can do to control many of the major stresses in a patient’s life: they occur too randomly, and thus are difficult to predict and even more difficult to govern. But there are things that can be done to influence or treat the underlying biological vulnerabilities to suicide, as well as the mental illnesses closely linked to suicidal behavior. Lithium is the most effective, most extensively studied, and best-documented antisuicide medication now available. It has been used since 1949 to stabilize the dangerous mood swings and erratic behavior associated with manic-depressive illness and, by Europeans particularly, to prevent recurrent depressions. Its effectiveness in preventing suicide is probably due to its impact on two of the most potent risk factors",
          "increase in public awareness of suicide and its risk factors; an improvement in population-based and clinical services; and an investment in the advancement of the science of suicide prevention. The federal government has made a good start on the problem of suicide, but the effort will not go far without support from the public and without funding from the Congress and the state legislatures. Nor is major success at suicide prevention a realistic goal if treatment for mental illness remains unaffordable and out of the reach of millions of Americans because health insurance is poor or nonexistent; if hospital stays for the severely mentally ill are limited to days, rather than weeks; or if society continues to be unaware of the suffering of so many people in its midst. Streets and jails are no places for the mentally ill. The challenges to policy remain substantial. But increasing numbers of successful approaches promise important gains for directed public action. Much remains to be learned about how to prevent suicide. But, as the Surgeon General’s report convincingly argues, much can now be",

          "Science of Sleep: What You Need to Know Sleep is essential to our overall health and functioning, yet many of us struggle to achieve restful nights. Understanding the science of sleep forms the foundation of addressing insomnia effectively. To begin with, the sleep cycle is composed of several stages that occur in a predictable pattern through the night. These include light sleep, deep sleep, and REM (Rapid Eye Movement) sleep. Each stage plays a critical role in physical restoration, memory consolidation, and emotional regulation. Light sleep prepares the body for deeper stages, while REM sleep is where most dreaming occurs and is vital for cognitive functions. Lifestyle habits significantly influence sleep quality. Factors such as diet, exercise, and stress management can either support or hinder restful sleep. For instance, engaging in regular physical activity can help you fall asleep faster and enjoy deeper sleep. Conversely, excessive consumption of caffeine or heavy meals before bedtime can disrupt the natural sleep cycle. Additionally, stress and anxiety can lead to difficulties in both falling and staying asleep, emphasizing 1 . Scan to Download",
