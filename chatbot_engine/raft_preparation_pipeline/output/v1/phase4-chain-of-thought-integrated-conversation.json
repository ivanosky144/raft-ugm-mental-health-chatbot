Because depression has been viewed as an emotional disorder throughout the history of psychiatry, therapists from most schools of thought place a strong emphasis on ‘*setting in touch’’ with your feelings. Our research reveals the unexpected: Depression is not an emotional disorder at all! The sudden change in the way you feel is of no more causal relevance than a runny nose 1s when you have a cold. Every bad feeling you have is the result of your distorted negative thinking. [logical pessimistic attitudes play the central role in the development and continuation of all your symptoms. Intense negative thinking always accompanies a depres- sive episode, or any painful emotion for that matter. Your moody thoughts are likely to be entirely different from those you have when you"

Inappropriate should and shouldn’t statements represent the fourth type of distortion that feeds your anger. When you find that some people’s actions are not to your liking, you tell yourself they *“*shouldn’t’’ have done what they did, or they “‘should have’’ done something they failed to do. For example, suppose you register at a hotel and discover they lost the record of your reservation, and now there are no rooms available. You furiously insist, ‘“This shouldn't have happened! Those stupid goddam clerks!’’ Does the actual deprivation cause your anger? No. The deprivation can only create a sense of loss, disappointment, Or inconvenience. Before you can feel anger, you must necessarily make the interpretation you are entitled to get what you want in this situation. Consequently, you see the goof-up on your reservation as an injustice. This perception leads to your feeling angry. SO what’s wrong with that? When you say the clerks shouldn’t have",

Certainly that’s your fault, isn’t it?’’ This is a second type of rejection, which I call ‘‘angry rejection. ’’ Again, I think you will see that it’s not your fault if you are angrily rejected because of a personal fault. In the first place, other people aren’t obliged to reject you just because they find things about you they don’t like— they have other options. They can be assertive and point out what they don’t like about your behavior, or they can learn not to let 1t bother them so much.

All of the reactions described above apply as well to anger, including the last. Many times I have watched a person's anger heighten rapidly until it reached its limit, broke away, and left the person shaking and crying as the fear, which lay beneath, surfaced. The fact that anger acts as a defense mechanism doesn't mean it is not an emotion. It involves a physiological response, which can be labeled, to an external event. It prepares the body to ward off an attack. That is the function of this emotion. To try to make anger fit the mold and react like other feelings denies its very character.

Despite this realization, I had two reasons for continuing to encourage people to express anger freely. Anger is a feeling, and I believe that the sharing of feelings leads to more substantial relationships. I also had bought into the \"reservoir theory\": a person doesn't let anger out, but carries it around, adding new supplies each time anger occurs and remains unexpressed; eventually it overflows in the form of an aggressive, violent explosion. Ventilation lowers the level of the reservoir and averts violence. In 1980, when I was asked to train professionals to help angry clients, I researched the subject. I wanted to back up my theories with other professionals' techniques and the results from studies. As I read over a hundred articles, research studies, and books, I found that many counseling professionals held beliefs similar to my own and were acting accordingly. But the research didn't always support our practices. Below is a synopsis of information",

It was not her angry feeling that worried me, but the behavior that she might use to express that anger had me on edge. That principle applies to anyone's anger. It is not the emotion that is destructive, but the way a person expresses it. Since my boss is not a vindictive person, my anxiety over a lost job had little to do with her and much more to do with memy fears and my learned expectations.

If you have a tendency to interpret unpleasant bodily sensations as portending something dangerous or catastrophic, you will also tend to constantly monitor your body to see if you’re having those sensations. You’re probably very tuned in to your internal bodily states and overreact easily if something begins to feel slightly “off” or unusual. This increased internalization compounds the problem, because you’re more likely to notice and magnify any sudden change in your body’s internal state that is slightly unusual or unpleasant. The variety of circumstances that might cause a sudden aberration in your body’s internal physiological state is legion. Sometimes the cause lies outside of your body. For example, an argument with your spouse, seeing something unpleasant on TV, hearing your alarm clock go off, or being in a hurry to get somewhere could trigger an increase in heart rate, chest constriction, stomach queasiness, or any of a wide range of bodily symptoms associated with anxiety.

This is not a knee-jerk, reflexive distraction or escape from worry that may only tend to increase it. Instead, you need to become engaged in a project or an activity so that your concentration shifts away from your worries about a possible future danger. This might involve engaging in 1) a practical activity that is inherently enjoyable or 2) a practical strategy for completing some immediate task at hand (for example, driving far from home or making a speech). The stance you take toward the activity you choose to disrupt your worry is critical. You’re aiming for a stance of acceptance, in spite of whatever worry might be going on. Because you can’t force worry to go away, it’s entirely okay for worry to come up.

If you’ve worked hard on overcoming your condition but are still troubled by it, perhaps there is some significant growth experience to find in the process of having to work with your difficulty for a long time. It all depends upon the lesson you happen to be learning.

I, after all, had been dangerously suicidal myself on several occasions since our Bistro Gardens compact and certainly had not called him. Nor had I even thought of calling. Suicide is not beholden to an evening’s promises, nor does it always hearken to plans drawn up in lucid moments and banked in good intentions. I know this for an unfortunate fact. Suicide has been a professional interest of mine for more than twenty years, and a very personal one for considerably longer. I have a hard-earned respect for suicide’s ability to undermine, overwhelm, outwit, devastate, and destroy. As a clinician, researcher, and teacher I have known or consulted on patients who hanged, shot, or asphyxiated themselves; jumped to their deaths from stairwells, buildings, or overpasses; died from poisons, fumes, prescription drugs; or slashed their wrists or cut their throats. Close friends, fellow students from graduate school, colleagues, and children of colleagues have done similar or the same. Most were",

The peak months for suicide were, with rare exceptions, in the late spring and summer. Likewise, the lowest rates were always found in the winter months. This late-spring-to-summer peak has also been found in a series of Belgian, Finnish, American, and Chinese studies completed since the time of the review. Seasonal variation in suicide appears to correlate not with the dark and dismal months but with the brightness and extended duration of spring and summer light instead. Consistent with this, studies carried out in the Southern Hemisphere—in Australia, Chile, Uruguay, and South Africa—show that suicide peaks in the months making up their springs and summers. In the Northern Hemisphere, men have one peak in suicide—in April, May, and the summer months—whereas women appear to share that peak but to have a second smaller one in October and November as well. 15 a England 14 1485-1715 A Europe 13 1840-1876 England ~~-O-—\" 1865-1884 15 World Health —e— Organization countries 1951-1959 United"

However, there are many different theories as to what causes experiences such as hearing voices. The idea that they are symptoms of illness, perhaps caused by some sort of chemical imbalance or other problem in the brain, is just one of the theories. There is no objective biological test such as a blood test or scan for diagnosing mental illness. There is a vigorous debate about whether it is meaningful or useful to think of these experiences as symptoms of mental illnesses. The main issues that are debated are: e The extent to which psychotic experiences can be separated from normal ones e The frequency with which ‘normal’ as well as ‘ill’ people experience these things e The extent to which clinicians can agree on"

The past decade, however (since, indeed, the publication of our first report),' has seen a steady increase in research exploring individual experiences such as hearing voices.’ Researchers have also discovered that many people will not be counted in any figures because they do not find their experiences distressing and therefore do not seek help from mental health professionals.* However, much research still relies on psychiatric diagnoses given to people who come into contact with services.

When we are feeling stressed, anxious, depressed or overwhelmed, the ways that we think about the world and ourselves change. We become more self-conscious, more self-critical, and more aware of risks and dangers. If we suspect that people are trying to harm us, or worry that the voices we hear can do bad things, we are likely to be more easily convinced when we are ina negative emotional state. And, of course, these links work the other way round as well. If you are hearing voices threatening to do bad things, you are quite likely to be anxious, suspicious and perhaps depressed. This close relationship with emotions means that anything that helps with emotional problems (for example, dealing with sources of stress, or perhaps psychological therapy focused on anxiety or depression) can also help with psychosis.”’ Similarly, if someone is experiencing a crisis where their experiences are overwhelming, anything that can help them feel calmer (kind, reassuring words, for example, or good"

As his supply of Adderall ran out, he felt depressed, irritable, unmotivated, and unable to concentrate. His parents came to visit him at school just prior to spring break, and without a thought, he took his mother’s checkbook out of her purse and wrote himself several checks of a few hundred dollars each to cash. Maybe, he thought, if the amounts were not so large and he cashed them gradually, she wouldn't notice. After only a few weeks of alternating , Charlie felt"

If you are like most people, you started drinking for one of three reasons: ¢ Alcohol or drugs made you feel really good. ¢ They helped you to feel better when you were not feeling well (for example, when you were in physical pain or discomfort, or when you were experienc- ing negative emotions such as sadness, anxiety, or anger). ¢ They enhanced your performance at something (for example, sports or the ability to work long hours without getting tired). If you were seeking the good, pleasurable feelings, or the performance enhance- ment, then your motivation was for what is known as positive reinforcement. If you were trying to alleviate physical or emotional pain, then you were “self-medicating” with alcohol or drugs.

Another important thing to remember is to catch yourself if you find that you are getting into the spiraling lapse mindset. In chapter 5, we discussed how sometimes when you experience a slip or a lapse, it can trigger dysfunctional thoughts like, I’ve blown it. I'm a total failure. I'll never stay sober. I have nothing to lose by continuing to drink (or use). Beware of the spiraling lapse frame of mind; it is a sure pathway from a slip to a full-blown relapse. You can avoid it by recognizing it for what it is, and intentionally bringing your thoughts into a more CBT-oriented mindset, in which you view the slip as a learning opportunity that",

The same goes for other uncomfortable emotions, such as sadness, grief, anxiety, or anger. When you try to run away from these feelings, they usually come back stronger. A key aspect of practicing mindfulness is learning to accept that discomfort is there, while rec- ognizing at the same time that your actions don’t have to be dictated by your natural desire to get rid of it.

You may recall that in chapter 2, you learned about how your use of alcohol or drugs can become a conditioned, automatic response to certain cues, much like a habit. When drinking or using drugs becomes associated, or “linked,” with certain situations, emotions, people, or things, then those become triggers. Because that psy- chological link between triggers and using substances can be very powerful, being in the presence of these triggers can become quite uncomfortable without alcohol or drugs. You'll experience this discomfort as a craving. Studies have shown that triggers fall into several categories (Marlatt and Gordon 1985; Larimer, Palmer, and Marlatt 1999).

One day, he goes to work and his boss asks to meet with him. Scott’s boss says that one of the clients he has been working with is complaining that he has been too slow to resolve problems with his new software, and that he was not very polite in his email when this issue was raised. Scott’s boss is writing him up, and warns him that he needs to improve his efficiency and customer service to meet performance standards. So, there it is: a triggering interpersonal situation.

That experience includes what you think about the trigger and how it feels to want to neutralize it. When we skip over this middle part, however, we miss the opportunity to interfere in the obsessive-compulsive cycle. If we are mindful, by which I mean if we can stay present with the trigger, our experience of it, and the urge to do compulsions, then there is an opportunity to stand up to the OCD. Understanding What a Mind Does Consider that your mind is just whatever it is that you look through in order to see what’s going on inside the brain. Your mind is like a flashlight that you point at different territories in a landscape made up of ideas, emotions, and sensations. You can have any kind of thought that is available to be had, and when you say you are having a particular thought, you mean you are shining the light on this idea in this present moment.",

The problem is that you mistake the simple awareness of this thought for having an intrinsic meaning, instead of just being a mental event that comes with having an OCD mind. Therefore mindfulness, the skill of observing mental events without judgment or analysis, is an essential aspect of mastering the disorder. The brain records actions much more clearly than thoughts, feelings, or intentions. What this means is that the parent who changes the child’s diaper while having intrusive thoughts about committing some vile act in the process is actually recording more helpful information than the parent who is avoiding changing the diaper and the intrusive thoughts. The person who allows the thoughts but not the avoidance is actually programming the brain to perceive the thoughts as irrelevant and the value of the interaction as the most important element. The avoidant person is establishing only that diaper-changing is a threat. One way to keep this concept in mind is",

You also allow yourself to notice their beauty, the way they move, the different shapes they come in, and so on. They are more than just the thoughts and feelings they elicit. Having OCD feels a lot like being in a shark tank with the sharks. When you see a shark coming at you, you don’t just tread water and observe it. You scramble to get away. Your thoughts, like sharks, seem like they can destroy you. Mindfulness means remembering that you are not in the shark tank—you are in the aquarium.

Given the content of these types of obsessions, one might assume they only occur to adults, but in fact taboo themes of violence, sex, and religious sacrilege frequently come up in pediatric OCD (Masi et al. 2005).

Sometimes - for example when we've drunk alcohol or taken drugs, or sometimes even when we haven't - the way our brain is functioning can affect our judgement. But in each case, we are actively making sense of our world. Recent research into ‘psychotic’ experiences has found that often this sense-making or interpretation of events (‘cognitive factors’ in technical language) can play an important role. Unusual beliefs (‘delusions’) are very similar to other beliefs or prejudices. Many ‘normal’ beliefs involve a resistance to change and a bias towards evidence that confirms one's initial suspicions.® An example might be a football supporter who sees one win as confirmation that his or her team is the best, despite a long run of lost matches. We can probably all think of friends or family members who hold on to particular beliefs despite - as we see it anyway - all the evidence.

However, there are many different theories as to what causes experiences such as hearing voices. The idea that they are symptoms of illness, perhaps caused by some sort of chemical imbalance or other problem in the brain, is just one of the theories. There is no objective biological test such as a blood test or scan for diagnosing mental illness. There is a vigorous debate about whether it is meaningful or useful to think of these experiences as symptoms of mental illnesses.

Nevertheless, until recently much research published in academic journals was based on this assumption, and so the only estimates available tend to be numbers of people who have received a certain diagnosis. The past decade, however (since, indeed, the publication of our first report),' has seen a steady increase in research exploring individual experiences such as hearing voices.’ Researchers have also discovered that many people will not be counted in any figures because they do not find their experiences distressing and therefore do not seek help from mental health professionals.* However, much research still relies on psychiatric diagnoses given to people who come into contact with services.

Every time you hear that inner criticism, you notice that you cringe, your body gets tight, your head hangs down, and you do not want to move. When you can notice your tendency to react without doing so immediately, you can then begin to respond differently. You can be curious about why that voice is there (you may have always assumed it is there just to speak the “truth” about yourself, but there are likely other reasons). You could begin to dialogue with the part whose voice you are hearing. You could ask that part of you to help, and begin to work to develop inner empathy and cooperation, as you will be learning through this manual. You can empathize with yourself about how painful it is to always feel criticized, scared, less than others, hopeless.

You might also imagine a safe and trusted other person standing beside you to support you in the situation. * Blending. Various forms of blending (which were discussed in chapter 25) can be useful in helping parts learn to be more assertive. As a first step, for example, a fearful part could look through the eyes of the adult part that is being assertive, to gradually become more familiar with the skills for and benefits of assertiveness. As you become more comfortable with blending, a more aggressive part might be willing to blend with parts that have better assertive skills, or even pair with a more fearful part to support that part in being stronger and more assertive. Check with your therapist to get help with blending, if needed. ¢ Take a time-out. When you are suddenly confronted with a situation where you immediately need to be assertive, you will not have",

Sometimes - for example when we've drunk alcohol or taken drugs, or sometimes even when we haven't - the way our brain is functioning can affect our judgement. But in each case, we are actively making sense of our world. Recent research into ‘psychotic’ experiences has found that often this sense-making or interpretation of events (‘cognitive factors’ in technical language) can play an important role. Unusual beliefs (‘delusions’) are very similar to other beliefs or prejudices. Many ‘normal’ beliefs involve a resistance to change and a bias towards evidence that confirms one's initial suspicions.® An example might be a football supporter who sees one win as confirmation that his or her team is the best, despite a long run of lost matches. We can probably all think of friends or family members who hold on to particular beliefs despite - as we see it anyway - all the evidence.

To me, \"upset\" means terribly sad; to someone else, it means \"angry\"; to another, \"afraid.\" These labels lead to emotional confusion in the person who uses them and misunderstanding in those who hear them. One of my experiences shows how people can fail to communicate. Somehow I have learned that \"excited\" means sexually aroused. I was working in an outpatient clinic on an especially hard day when my last client arrived. He was a sixty-seven-year-old man, balding and toothless. He wore a dirty coat and appeared not to have had a bath in quite a while. As I was confronting him about some of his inappropriate behaviors, he turned to me and said, \"Lorrainne, you're getting me excited.\" My immediate thought was, \"It's too late in the day to deal with this kind of thing.\" I still thank God that I asked my client for clarification and didn't respond according to my assumption about the meaning of \"excited.\" What he was trying to tell me",

There are counselors and groups at shelters, mental health clinics, and social service departments whose main purpose is to assist people who are in potentially violent situations. Understand several facts: - You did not cause the violent behavior. - The behavior will not automatically stop. - You have the right to seek assistance. Understand and attempt to use your own anger productively. As long as you believe the misinformation about anger that you have carried since childhood, and as long as your own anger causes you intense discomfort, you won't be able to respond effectively to other people's angry feelings. You won't be able to listen properly to the person's message, or to respond assertively if she expresses her anger aggressively. I therefore recommend that you review the informational areas and the exercises in this manual again to be sure that you have attained enough understanding and comfort with your own anger to be effective when you respond to another's.

          "led you to use alcohol or drugs either to avoid unpleasant feelings or to prolong positive ones. One of the biggest challenges this poses in recovery is that the more you follow your tendency to try and avoid or get rid of the unpleasant feelings and sensations that cravings bring about, the more intense they tend to get. The same goes for other uncomfortable emotions, such as sadness, grief, anxiety, or anger. When you try to run away from these feelings, they usually come back stronger. A key aspect of practicing mindfulness is learning to accept that discomfort is there, while rec- ognizing at the same time that your actions don’t have to be dictated by your natural desire to get rid of it. Here are a few things you can tell yourself to practice acceptance: * It’s okay for me to see things just as they are right now, as opposed to the way I think they should be. * Just because I accept the way that I am feeling right now, it doesn’t mean that I am satisfied"

Now, those things themselves, because of the strong associa- tion in your mind between them and using pot, can trigger very strong urges to get high. For someone who has just stopped smoking pot, opening a drawer and finding a pipe in it can create a powerful craving.

          "it is a fallacy to assume that anxiety disorders are solely (or even primarily) caused by physiological imbalances. The psychological fallacy makes the same kind of mistake in the opposite direction. It assumes that, say, social phobia or generalized anxiety disorder is caused by having grown up with parents who neglected, abandoned, or abused you, resulting in a deep-seated sense of insecurity or shame that causes your current phobic avoidance and anxiety as an adult. While it may be true that your family background contributed in an important way to your current problems, is it reasonable to assume that this is the only cause? Again, not really. To do so overlooks the possible contributions of hereditary and biological factors. After all, not all children who grow up in dysfunctional families develop anxiety disorders. It is more plausible to assume that your problem is a result of both 1) a hereditary predisposition toward anxiety (and possibly phobia) and 2) early childhood conditions that fostered a sense of shame and/or insecurity.

          "straight to some behavior that relieves the pain (a compulsion). But between the trigger and the compulsion is an experience. That experience includes what you think about the trigger and how it feels to want to neutralize it. When we skip over this middle part, however, we miss the opportunity to interfere in the obsessive-compulsive cycle. If we are mindful, by which I mean if we can stay present with the trigger, our experience of it, and the urge to do compulsions, then there is an opportunity to stand up to the OCD. Understanding What a Mind Does Consider that your mind is just whatever it is that you look through in order to see what’s going on inside the brain. Your mind is like a flashlight that you point at different territories in a landscape made up of ideas, emotions, and sensations. You can have any kind of thought that is available to be had, and when you say you are having a particular thought, you mean you are shining the light on this idea in this present moment.",

She stopped trying to convince herself she was safe because she had things she loved in life and instead just loved the things in her life. ° Her triggering thoughts flared up from time to time, especially around stressful events, but she reminded her husband not to reassure her during these times and not to let her avoid the household cleaners or medicine cabinet. * She practiced mindfulness and used ERP when thoughts got sticky. She knows all the lyrics to Nevermind by Nirvana. Richard Richard’s Harm OCD told him he was going to shoot his infant child with a gun, despite the fact that he hated guns",
          "If you struggle with morality TAF you may feel that you have to do compulsions to escape the shame of negative self-judgment that comes with believing you are a bad person for having bad thoughts. Both may be in play. Being able to recognize when your compulsive behavior is being driven by the mere presence of your violent thoughts can help you step back and remember: Thoughts and actions are not the same thing. Catastrophizing: This means predicting a negative future and assuming you can’t cope with it. Understanding catastrophizing in the context of Harm OCD can be tricky. Of course what you're thinking is catastrophic, and of course coping with it seems impossible! The thing to understand about this way of thinking is simply that we cannot predict the future. This does not mean we have to assume the future is bad, or even that there is a fifty-fifty chance that it will be bad (recall the discussion on uncertainty from earlier in this chapter). What it means is that when we allow OCD to trick us into thinking"

If you have knives, pills, and so on locked away so that you don’t impulsively use them to cause harm, then you need to get them out in plain view as soon as you can. If you recall from the description of the obsessive-compulsive cycle in chapter 1, our compulsive behaviors actually reinforce the connection between obsessions, our beliefs about them, and how we feel we must respond to them. Naturally, the presence of harm thoughts can be discomforting and, therefore, you are initially driven to avoid that discomfort. Yet at the same time, when we avoid things, we send a message to the brain that those things are dangerous. To turn this around, we need to interact with the things we feel compelled to avoid and send a message to the brain that these things are not the threats they appear to be. We do this not by giving ourselves reassurances, but by demonstrating it with our behavior. The endgame is not to prove the obsession away, but to stop resisting",

Some thoughts are more pleasant to shine a light on than others. The problem with OCD is that if you identify areas of your mental landscape to be off limits, that’s where the OCD goes. The OCD wants one thing only, to dominate your attention so that you engage in compulsions. So it’s no mystery that OCD plants its flag in the territory most offensive to you, the territory of causing harm. It adds insult to this injury by focusing the envisioned harm on the things you care the most about. If you try to avoid these territories, the OCD grows and starts staking its claim on areas you normally enjoy looking at. As Harm OCD worsens, your fear of knives, for example, becomes a fear of cooking, and then a fear of the kitchen, and then not even wanting to think about food. You have to be willing to",

Your OCD may make you feel doubtful about that code and its integrity, so this is understandably scary to consider. But the point is that ERP does not ask you to harm anyone or engage in any particular behavior you believe to be inherently wrong. When doing ERP you might want to ask yourself whether the feeling of immorality is coming from your values or from your OCD. For example, allowing yourself to have scary thoughts while using a knife to peel an apple in the same room as a loved one may feel immoral, as if you were using this innocent person as a guinea pig in a sick experiment. But using a knife to cut an apple in someone’s presence does not itself (presumably) go against your values. ¢ No testing.

OCD overall affects roughly 1-2% of children (Rapoport et al. 2000). Children who don’t have OCD are also grappling with new and sometimes frightening concepts every day in multiple environments, so it should come as no surprise that children who do have OCD can be significantly impaired by their OCD symptoms at home, in school, and in their social life (Piacentini et al. 2003). Given the content of these types of obsessions, one might assume they only occur to adults, but in fact taboo themes of violence, sex, and religious sacrilege frequently come up in pediatric OCD (Masi et al. 2005). Aggressive obsessions may range in prevalence from 32.6-75% of children with OCD (Storch et al. 2008). If you are a parent reading this, don’t worry about whether you caused this by allowing them to play the wrong video game or watch a movie above their maturity level. (Note",

If I treat my violent thoughts as just OCD chatter, I have to accept the possibility that they could be something more. If I accept the possibility that I may be wrong about OCD, that these thoughts may actually be dangerous signs or something like that, then how can I morally let them go? Shouldn’t I devote 100% of my energy and attention to making sure my potential sociopathic traits don’t go unchecked? Should there even be a limit to the amount of effort I put into making sure I am not a bad person? If I ever do hurt someone, the horror of that won't just be about the act itself, but about the fact that I was not vigilant enough to prevent it early on when I knew I had bad thoughts!

If I admit the truth, that no matter how much the effort I make, it is still limited, I am left vulnerable to attacks from the OCD saying that I am a harmful person. This can be viewed as Harm OCD too, whether it involves the presence of violent thoughts or not. When school is in session, I help get my kids ready in the morning and I wait with them for the bus at the bottom of the driveway. I spend as much time as I can protecting them, teaching them, entertaining them, and letting them know that they are loved. When the bus comes, I put them on it and I go to work.

Too many people get misdiagnosed either because they are seeing an untrained clinician or they are not articulating their symptoms in a way that allows the clinician to understand what is going on. This can unfortunately lead to nightmarish scenarios wherein people are unnecessarily hospitalized or erroneously reported to an authority as a safety concern. But it is also true that underdiagnosing can lead to other problems, and not just problems of harm. For example, people doing their best to fight OCD who don’t know that they are bipolar may be doing everything right, but still find themselves going back to square one every few weeks or months and thinking that they are a failure when in fact they are simply having a manic episode that is causing a flareup of obsessive symptoms.

That’s why you feel so totally down in the dumps. What’s the key to it all? Because depression has been viewed as an emotional disorder throughout the history of psychiatry, therapists from most schools of thought place a strong emphasis on ‘*setting in touch’’ with your feelings. Our research reveals the unexpected: Depression is not an emotional disorder at all! The sudden change in the way you feel is of no more causal relevance than a runny nose 1s when you have a cold. Every bad feeling you have is the result of your distorted negative thinking. [logical pessimistic attitudes play the central role in the development and continuation of all your symptoms.

Your health care provider may recommend specific job accommodations to your work responsibili- ties and schedule that may also be helpful in this transition. Typical job accommodations include more frequent breaks, time off to attend medical appointments, and a change in non-essential job duties. Educating your employer and co-workers about some of the typical signs of mood changes may be helpful in some cases. However, some people prefer not to discuss their illness with their employer. This choice will not allow you to ask for accommodations, but it does not mean that you will be unsuccessful in your transition back to work. In this situation it is especially important to have support outside of work to discuss your problems and concerns.

As you recover, investing energy in several areas will help you develop a more balanced and satisfying life, which will help you to avoid relapse. 7. Monitor your symptoms closely. Many people with bipolar disor- der have a consistent pattern of symptoms across episodes. For example, some people learn to recognize the early phase of an impending relapse through signs such as needing less sleep, be- coming irritable, or feeling that they no longer need medication. Monitoring such signs closely and seeking medical attention can stop a full-blown episode developing. Often, a mood diary or mood charting app can help. Most healthy people experience a variety of feelings that change from day to day—not all shifts in your mood are due to bipolar disorder.

Involving the police is a painful and difficult decision, although it is sometimes necessary in order to get an ill person to hospital.

Most jurisdictions in North America have mental health legisla- tion that permits involuntary hospitalization of people only if they threaten to harm themselves or other people, or cannot care for themselves. Many ill people who would benefit from hospitaliza- tion do not meet these criteria and therefore may refuse to enter the hospital, or leave the hospital against medical advice. Families usually have a very hard time living with a person with mania who refuses treatment and who cannot be legally hospitalized or kept in hospital. In these situations, try to negotiate with your relative when it might be best to leave the hospital.

However, a person who is severely depressed and suicidal may refuse treatment because he or she feels so hopeless and worthless.

I, after all, had been dangerously suicidal myself on several occasions since our Bistro Gardens compact and certainly had not called him. Nor had I even thought of calling. Suicide is not beholden to an evening’s promises, nor does it always hearken to plans drawn up in lucid moments and banked in good intentions. I know this for an unfortunate fact. Suicide has been a professional interest of mine for more than twenty years, and a very personal one for considerably longer. I have a hard-earned respect for suicide’s ability to undermine, overwhelm, outwit, devastate, and destroy.

Until that time I had taken for granted, and loved more than I knew, a temperamental lightness of mood and a fabulous expectation of life. I knew death only in the most abstract of senses; I never imagined it would be something to arrange or seek.

          "in some detail with psychotherapy and with family education and involvement. Here we delve into what is known about the effectiveness of different kinds of medication in preventing suicide. Suicide usually requires multiple “hits”—a biological predisposition, a major psychiatric illness, and an acute life stress—but only some of these “hits” are amenable to change. There is, for example, relatively little a doctor can do to control many of the major stresses in a patient’s life: they occur too randomly, and thus are difficult to predict and even more difficult to govern. But there are things that can be done to influence or treat the underlying biological vulnerabilities to suicide, as well as the mental illnesses closely linked to suicidal behavior. Lithium is the most effective, most extensively studied, and best-documented antisuicide medication now available. It has been used since 1949 to stabilize the dangerous mood swings and erratic behavior associated with manic-depressive illness and, by Europeans particularly, to prevent recurrent depressions. Its effectiveness in preventing suicide is probably due to its impact on two of the most potent risk factors",

The federal government has made a good start on the problem of suicide, but the effort will not go far without support from the public and without funding from the Congress and the state legislatures. Nor is major success at suicide prevention a realistic goal if treatment for mental illness remains unaffordable and out of the reach of millions of Americans because health insurance is poor or nonexistent; if hospital stays for the severely mentally ill are limited to days, rather than weeks; or if society continues to be unaware of the suffering of so many people in its midst. Streets and jails are no places for the mentally ill. The challenges to policy remain substantial. But increasing numbers of successful approaches promise important gains for directed public action. Much remains to be learned about how to prevent suicide. But, as the Surgeon General’s report convincingly argues, much can now be",

          "Science of Sleep: What You Need to Know Sleep is essential to our overall health and functioning, yet many of us struggle to achieve restful nights. Understanding the science of sleep forms the foundation of addressing insomnia effectively. To begin with, the sleep cycle is composed of several stages that occur in a predictable pattern through the night. These include light sleep, deep sleep, and REM (Rapid Eye Movement) sleep. Each stage plays a critical role in physical restoration, memory consolidation, and emotional regulation. Light sleep prepares the body for deeper stages, while REM sleep is where most dreaming occurs and is vital for cognitive functions. Lifestyle habits significantly influence sleep quality. Factors such as diet, exercise, and stress management can either support or hinder restful sleep. For instance, engaging in regular physical activity can help you fall asleep faster and enjoy deeper sleep. Conversely, excessive consumption of caffeine or heavy meals before bedtime can disrupt the natural sleep cycle. Additionally, stress and anxiety can lead to difficulties in both falling and staying asleep, emphasizing 1 . Scan to Download",
