The psychologists Larry Jacoby, Bob Bjork, and Colleen Kelley, summing up studies on illu- sions of comprehension, competence, and remembering, write that it is nearly impossible to avoid basing one\u2019s judgments on subjective experience. Humans do not give greater credence to an objective record of a past event than to their subjective remembering of it, and we are surprisingly insensitive to the ways our particular construals of a situation are unique to ourselves. Thus the narrative of memory becomes central to our intuitions regarding the judgments we make and the ac- tions we take.\u00b0 Make It Stick * 112 It is a confounding paradox, then, that the changeable na- ture of our memory not only can skew our perceptions but also is essential to our ability to learn.

Memory can be distorted in many ways. People interpret a story in light of their world knowledge, imposing order where none had been present so as to make a more logical story. Memory is a reconstruction. We cannot remember every as- pect of an event, so we remember those elements that have greatest emotional significance for us, and we fill in the gaps with details of our own that are consistent with our narrative but may be wrong. People remember things that were implied but not specifi- cally stated. The literature is full of examples.

Emotions are spontaneous (involuntary) reactions to events outside and inside ourselves. They are primary guides that help us best adapt our behavior to what is happening in the present.

One always led to more, and more led you to prob- lems in your life. Yet even the problems weren't enough to give you the strength to stop.

When drinking or using drugs becomes associated, or \u201clinked,\u201d with certain situations, emotions, people, or things, then those become triggers. Because that psy- chological link between triggers and using substances can be very powerful, being in the presence of these triggers can become quite uncomfortable without alcohol or drugs.

This misinformation then becomes the foundation for strongly entrenched attitudes about anger that result in its misuse. Changing attitudes and developing new behaviors involve hard work and effort. Entrenched and deeply hidden attitudes must be brought to light, knowledge and understanding gained, new ways of responding developed and practiced. At times the task seems too difficult and tiring.

Many times I have watched a person's anger heighten rapidly until it reached its limit, broke away, and left the person shaking and crying as the fear, which lay beneath, surfaced. The fact that anger acts as a defense mechanism doesn't mean it is not an emotion. It involves a physiological response, which can be labeled, to an external event. It prepares the body to ward off an attack. That is the function of this emotion. To try to make anger fit the mold and react like other feelings denies its very character.

For instance, I feel some level of anger when someone pulls into a parking space that I was aiming for; the grocery cart I choose has a defective wheel; people block the aisle with their carts, and they're nowhere in sight; I carefully pick only nine items (foregoing my favorite snack to make the nine) so I can use the express lane, and the woman in front of me has twelve items and pays by check; the store uses only tiny plastic bags that hold five items, instead of paper bags with three times that capacity; or I return to my car, and someone has rammed a cart into it.

After about half an hour, she suddenly stopped in the middle of a laugh and began sobbing. Her defense of laughter had been stretched beyond its limit. All of the reactions described above apply as well to anger, including the last. Many times I have watched a person's anger heighten rapidly until it reached its limit, broke away, and left the person shaking and crying as the fear, which lay beneath, surfaced. The fact that anger acts as a defense mechanism doesn't mean it is not an emotion. It involves a physiological response, which can be labeled, to an external event. It prepares the body to ward off an attack. That is the function of this emotion. To try to make anger fit the mold and react like other feelings denies its very character. So far, anger of the neocortex seems similar to that of the old brain. Born of fear, it functions to protect and defend. It differs from"

But in each case, we are actively making sense of our world. Recent research into \u2018psychotic\u2019 experiences has found that often this sense-making or interpretation of events (\u2018cognitive factors\u2019 in technical language) can play an important role. Unusual beliefs (\u2018delusions\u2019) are very similar to other beliefs or prejudices. Many \u2018normal\u2019 beliefs involve a resistance to change and a bias towards evidence that confirms one's initial suspicions.\u00ae An example might be a football supporter who sees one win as confirmation that his or her team is the best, despite a long run of lost matches. We can probably all think of friends or family members who hold on to particular beliefs despite - as we see it anyway - all the evidence. Understanding Psychosis 47 There is a vigorous debate over what might lead to someone developing a particular \u2018delusional\u2019"

Even at their most subtle, these sensations have a huge influence on the small and large decisions we make throughout our lives: what we choose to eat, where we like to sleep and with whom, what music we prefer, whether we like to garden or sing in a choir, and whom we befriend and whom we detest. The emotional brain\u2019s cellular organization and biochemistry are simpler than those of the neocortex, our rational brain, and it assesses incoming information in a more global way. As a result, it jumps to conclusions based on rough similarities, in contrast with the rational brain, which is organized to sort through a complex set of options.

They are a bit like internal weather, coming and going, changing from time to time, flowing from one to the other, sometimes stormy, sometimes calm. This internal weather is as normal and expected as outside weather. And like weather, emotions are influenced by various environmental stimuli, either internal or external effects. Emotions are spontaneous (involuntary) reactions to events outside and inside ourselves. They are primary guides that help us best adapt our behavior to what is happening in the present. For example, love helps us be closer to someone we care about; fear helps us avoid a dangerous situation; joy helps us seek out pleasant experiences.

Many times I have watched a person's anger heighten rapidly until it reached its limit, broke away, and left the person shaking and crying as the fear, which lay beneath, surfaced. The fact that anger acts as a defense mechanism doesn't mean it is not an emotion. It involves a physiological response, which can be labeled, to an external event. It prepares the body to ward off an attack. That is the function of this emotion. To try to make anger fit the mold and react like other feelings denies its very character.

Pendekatan klinis yang perlu diadopsi adalah sikap empatik dan non-judgmental, yang mengakui bahwa menyimpan kemarahan bisa menjadi respons coping, namun juga membuka ruang untuk eksplorasi lebih lanjut tentang bagaimana kemarahan tersebut dapat diekspresikan dengan cara yang lebih aman dan bermanfaat. Oleh karena itu, pertanyaan perlu dirumuskan ulang agar lebih sensitif dan mengundang refleksi, seperti: 'Bisa ceritakan lebih lanjut tentang saat-saat ketika Anda merasa marah? Apa yang biasanya Anda rasakan di tubuh atau pikiran Anda saat itu?'.",
          "assistant_question": "Saya bisa merasakan bahwa Anda sedang bergumul dengan perasaan bingung dan tidak yakin tentang arah hidup Anda. Boleh ceritakan lebih lanjut, apakah Anda merasa bahwa hidup Anda saat ini kurang memiliki tujuan atau makna yang jelas?"

We'll come back to these students, but first a few more words about this technique, which is surprisingly effective and derives from the way imagery serves to contribute vivid- ness and connective links to memory. Humans remember pictures more easily than words. (For example, the image of an elephant is easier to recall than the word \u201celephant.\u201d) So it stands to reason that associating vivid mental images with verbal or abstract material makes that material easier to re- trieve from memory.

I ask them to pay attention to subtle shifts in their bodies, such as tightness in their chests or gnawing in their bellies, when they talk about negative events that they claim did not bother them. Noticing sensations for the first time can be quite distressing, and it may precipitate flashbacks in which people curl up or assume defensive postures.

The challenge is: How can people gain control over the residues of past trauma and return to being masters of their own ship? Talking, understanding, and human connections help, and drugs can dampen hyperactive alarm systems. But we will also see that the imprints from the past can be transformed by having physical experiences that directly contradict the helplessness, rage, and collapse that are part of trauma, and thereby regaining self-mastery.

REVISING THE PAST Let me give an example from a workshop I led not long ago at the Esalen Institute in Big Sur, California. Maria was a slender, athletic Filipina in her midforties who had been pleasant and accommodating during our first two days, which had been devoted to exploring the long-term impact of trauma and teaching self-regulation techniques. But now, seated on her pillow about six feet away from me, she looked scared and collapsed. I wondered to myself if she had volunteered as a protagonist mainly to please the girlfriend who had accompanied her to the workshop. I began by encouraging her to notice what was going on inside her and to share whatever came to mind. After a long silence she said: \u201cI can\u2019t really feel anything in my body, and my mind is blank.\u201d Mirroring her inner tension, I replied: \u201cA witness can see how worried you are that your mind is blank and you don\u2019t feel anything after volunteering to do a structure."

The anxiety usually increases as the time of the performance approaches. For many, the anxiety goes away as soon as they actually start speaking, singing, or performing. Others, however, continue to have distracting symptoms during the performance, such as pounding heart, hand tremors, sweating, nausea, or dry mouth. In the worst case, the anxiety becomes severe enough to interfere with the performance and/or disrupt speech.

This cycle may go on and on. You may label yourself as crazy because you hear this voice and you feel very ashamed (see chapter 24). Reflective skills can help you observe the process of what happens when you hear this voice, and to change your reaction to it, and eventually to change the entire interchange between you and that critical part of you. You can begin to notice what you feel as you hear that voice: perhaps crazy, or afraid, or ashamed, or frustrated.
