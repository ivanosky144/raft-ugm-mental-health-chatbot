Entrenched and deeply hidden attitudes must be brought to light, knowledge and understanding gained, new ways of responding developed and practiced. At times the task seems too difficult and tiring.

Dalam konteks ini, penting untuk memahami bagaimana emosi ini dirasakan secara fisik, mengingat bahwa trauma seringkali tidak hanya dialami secara mental tetapi juga tercermin dalam sensasi tubuh. Oleh karena itu, pendekatan yang lebih empatik dan sensitif terhadap pengalaman tubuh pengguna bisa membantu membuka percakapan lebih lanjut tentang dampak trauma. Referensi dari teks yang membahas hubungan antara emosi intens dan reaksi tubuh sangat relevan di sini, karena membantu menempatkan pertanyaan dalam konteks pengalaman holistik pengguna, bukan hanya dari sudut pandang psikologis kognitif.",

When drinking or using drugs becomes associated, or \u201clinked,\u201d with certain situations, emotions, people, or things, then those become triggers. Because that psy- chological link between triggers and using substances can be very powerful, being in the presence of these triggers can become quite uncomfortable without alcohol or drugs. You'll experience this discomfort as a craving. Studies have shown that triggers fall into several categories (Marlatt and Gordon 1985; Larimer, Palmer, and Marlatt 1999). As you become a self expert, think about which of these categories apply to you, so that you can learn to become more self- aware when you enter triggering situations: * Negative emotional states: Some people drink or use drugs as a way of \u201cself-medicating\u201d uncomfortable emotions such as anxiety, sadness, boredom,"
