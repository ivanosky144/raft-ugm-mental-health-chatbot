signed by Dr Kalathil, Professor Suman Fernando, Professor Philip Thomas and Dr Jan Wallcraft. It pointed out that the
report had engaged insufficiently with scholarship regarding the experiences of people from black and minority ethnic
communities in relation to psychosis and schizophrenia,' that people from these communities were not represented on

the author group, and that changes were needed to the language in some sections. Anne apologised for this and a
number of meetings took place to address these issues. This revised version published in 2017 includes amendments
addressing these issues and also the relationship between psychosis and social inequality more generally, drafted in
consultation with the signatories and with Professor Nimisha Patel. Other critiques of the report will be addressed in
future editions. This revised version of the original edition is dedicated to contributor Steve Onyett who sadly passed
away in 2015. His contribution to improving mental health care was immense. We miss you Steve;

Foreword

his report provides an overview of the current state of knowledge about why some people hear
voices, experience paranoia or have other experiences seen as ‘psychosis: It also describes what can
elp. In clinical language, the report concerns the ‘causes and treatment of schizophrenia and
other psychoses: A parallel report is available entitled Understanding Bipolar Disorder - Why People
Experience Extreme Mood States, and What Can Help’. In recent years we have made huge progress
in understanding the psychology of what had previously often been thought of as a largely
iological problem, an illness. Much has been written about the biological aspects: this report aims
to redress the balance by concentrating on the psychological and social aspects, both in terms of
jow we understand these experiences and also what can help when they become distressing.

We hope that this report will contribute to a fundamental change that is already underway in how
we as a society think about and offer help for ‘psychosis’ and ‘schizophrenia’ For example, we hope
that in future services will no longer insist that service users accept one particular view of their
roblem, namely the traditional view that they have an illness which needs to be treated primarily
y medication. The report is intended as a resource for people who work in mental health services,
eople who use them and their friends and relatives, to help ensure that their conversations are as
well informed and as useful as possible. It also contains vital information for those responsible for
commissioning and designing both services and professional training, as well as for journalists and
olicy-makers. We hope that it will help to change the way that we as a society think about not
only psychosis but also the other kinds of distress that are sometimes called mental illness.

the NHS and universities, and brought together by their professional body, the British Psychological
Society Division of Clinical Psychology. This report draws on and updates an earlier one, Recent
Advances in Understanding Mental Illness and Psychotic Experiences, which was published in 2000
and was widely read and cited.The contributors are leading experts and researchers in the field; a
full listing with affiliations is given at the end of the report. More than a quarter of the
contributors are experts by experience - people who have themselves heard voices, experienced
paranoia or received diagnoses such as psychosis or schizophrenia. At the end of the report there is

Understanding Psychosis


Executive Summary

@ This report describes a psychological approach to experiences that are commonly thought
of as psychosis, or sometimes schizophrenia. It complements parallel reports on the
experiences commonly thought of as bipolar disorder and depression.

i Hearing voices or feeling paranoid are common experiences which can often be a reaction
to trauma, abuse or deprivation. Calling them symptoms of mental illness, psychosis or
schizophrenia is only one way of thinking about them, with advantages and disadvantages.

m There is no clear dividing line between ‘psychosis’ and other thoughts, feelings and beliefs:
psychosis can be understood and treated in the same way as other psychological problems
such as anxiety or shyness. Significant progress has been made over the last twenty years
both in understanding the psychology of these experiences and in finding ways to help.

m@ = Some people find it useful to think of themselves as having an illness. Others prefer to
think of their problems as, for example, an aspect of their personality which sometimes
gets them into trouble but which they would not want to be without.

a In some cultures, experiences such as hearing voices are highly valued.

i Each individual's experiences are unique - no one person's problems, or ways of coping
with them, are exactly the same as anyone else's.

i For many people, though not all, experiences such as hearing voices or feeling paranoid
are short-lived. Even people who continue to experience them nevertheless often lead
happy and successful lives.

i It is a myth that people who have these experiences are likely to be violent.

i Psychological therapies - talking treatments - are very helpful for many people. The
National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommends that everyone with a
diagnosis of psychosis or schizophrenia should be offered talking therapy. However,
currently most people are unable to access it.

i More generally, it is vital that services offer people the chance to talk in detail about their
experiences and to make sense of what has happened to them. Surprisingly few currently
do. Professionals should not insist that people accept any one particular framework of
understanding, for example that their experiences are symptoms of an illness.

i Many people find that ‘antipsychotic’ medication helps to make the experiences less
frequent, intense or distressing. However, there is no evidence that it corrects an
underlying biological abnormality. Recent evidence also suggests that it carries significant
risks, particularly if taken long term.

i Psychosis is often related to experiences of abuse, deprivation, victimisation and racism.

m There is also racism and other forms of discrimination in services. People from black and
minority ethnic backgrounds, particularly young men, are more likely than others to be
diagnosed with schizophrenia, more likely to experience compulsion, more likely to be
given powerful drugs and less likely to be offered psychological therapy. In general people
from disadvantaged backgrounds also get a worse deal from services.

m Services need to change radically, and we need to invest in prevention by taking measures
to reduce abuse, deprivation and inequality.

Note on Terminology

here is considerable debate about the most helpful way of referring to the experiences described
in this report. The different terms used by different people reflect the more general debate - which
this report describes - about the nature and causes of these experiences.

raditionally, experiences such as having extremely suspicious thoughts (paranoia) or hearing voices
that no-one else can hear, have been seen as signs of mental illness, for example schizophrenia or
ipolar disorder. People who experience them have been referred to as ‘patients’ or ‘sufferers:
Whilst some people find this a helpful way of understanding what is going on, others do not, and
many people do not see themselves as having an illness. Indeed, over the past twenty years it has
ecome clear that there are many people in the general population who have these experiences

ut never need any kind of mental health care.

hroughout this report we have attempted to use terms which are as neutral as possible, and which
do not imply that there is only one correct way of understanding these experiences. Consequently
we refer to the experiences in question as ‘experiences’ rather than as ‘symptoms: We use the
ordinary English terms such as hearing voices or feeling suspicious or paranoid. Sometimes we use
the term ‘psychosis’ because it is the term in common use within our society to describe these
experiences. We recognise that not everyone is comfortable with this term. In recognition that not
everyone agrees that there is an underlying illness, we use the wording ‘people diagnosed with’
(schizophrenia, for example), rather than ‘people with schizophrenia’ For the same reason we refer
to people as people, rather than as patients.

Of course, much of what has been written previously in this area has used a clinical framework and
has therefore used clinical or medical terminology. When describing this work we have sometimes
used quotation marks round these terms.

Section 1: What this report is about:
experiences sometimes called psychosis

Key points

his report presents a psychological perspective on the experiences that are commonly thought
of as psychosis, or sometimes schizophrenia. It complements parallel reports on the experiences
commonly thought of as bipolar disorder’ and depression.”

hese experiences include hearing voices (‘hallucinations’), believing things that others find
strange (‘delusions’), speaking in a way that others find hard to follow (‘thought disorder’) and
experiencing periods of confusion where you appear out of touch with reality (‘acute
sychosis’).

Each individual's experiences are unique - no one person's experiences, or ways of coping with
them, are exactly the same as anyone else's.

Many people who have these kinds of experiences do not come into contact with mental

ealth services because they do not find their experiences distressing. Some people, however,
are so distressed by them that they seek professional help, or others seek help on their behalf.

1.1 What does it mean to experience psychosis?

This report is about those experiences that are usually thought of as ‘psychosis’, ‘schizophrenia’,
‘mental illness’, ‘nervous breakdown’ or sometimes ‘madness: A tendency to experience extreme
moods has also sometimes been seen as mental illness, in this case ‘bipolar disorder: Whilst many of
the issues are similar, ‘bipolar disorder’ is the subject of a separate report’ and so will not be
discussed at length here.

The types of experience discussed in this report include:

e Hearing voices speaking when there is no-one there, or seeing, tasting, smelling or feeling
things that other people do not. Sometimes these experiences have been called
hallucinations.

e Holding strong beliefs that others around you do not share. An example would be a belief
that there is a conspiracy against you by the CIA, or that someone else is controlling your
thoughts. Sometimes these beliefs have been referred to as delusions. If they are about other
people wanting to harm you, they have sometimes been called paranoid delusions. If they are
about being special, they have sometimes been called grandiose delusions.

e Difficulties with thinking and concentrating. Whilst many people who have experiences such
as those described here find ways to cope with them, or even find them helpful, for others
they can at times be overwhelming. At such times it is often hard to concentrate on other
things at the same time. People can appear distracted and preoccupied. They may talk back
to voices that they are hearing. Sometimes people talk in a way that other people find hard

10 Division of Clinical Psychology


to follow, mentioning many apparently unrelated topics in quick succession. This has
sometimes been referred to as ‘thought disorder. Many of us become somewhat ‘thought
disordered’ and say confused or confusing things when we are emotionally stressed.*

e At times, some people may appear inexpressive, withdrawn, listless, apathetic or unmotivated.
They may find it difficult even to find the energy to prepare food or generally to look after
themselves. Traditionally these difficulties have been thought of as ‘negative symptoms’: part
of an illness. However, they can often be a result of feeling overwhelmed by experiences and
trying to cope, or arise from feelings of helplessness and depression. They can also be
unwanted effects of the drugs that people are often prescribed.

Often these experiences occur at times of particular stress and are linked to strong emotions and
feelings, for example worry, anxiety, fear, depression or feeling overwhelmed by events. Indeed
there is no way of clearly separating ‘psychotic’ experiences from other emotional problems which
might attract diagnoses such as anxiety or depression, or from problems resulting from trauma
which might attract diagnoses such as ‘post-traumatic stress’ or ‘personality disorder’:

Different experiences of psychosis

It's like the whole of the top of your head comes off. There's just this incredible rush of energy
and, and hysteria almost. And, then | started to hallucinate visually, and | just saw this lovely
garden, and | thought oh this is heaven. And by that point | was completely lost because then |
had an alternative to that, and | really believed | was going to hell. | thought | was dying... I'm
not desperately religious. And | woke up and Mum came into the room and | was completely
gone. And we were kind of left to deal with it for a couple of days. | didn't understand what had
happened to me. | really thought | was dying. So | picked up a Bible [laughter in voice] and read
‘Revelations’ which is not a very good thing to do. And for two minutes | actually believed that |
was Christ, until | was logical enough to think, well I'm not male, so what's happening?

Rachel °

| began to think that... my blood had been poisoned by evil spirits and that | was evil, and that
there were spirits around me, warping my thoughts and changing my thoughts, and that was
very frightening and | didn't know what to do with it.

Graham °

Because | taught African and Caribbean culture, the transatlantic slave trade was a big part of
my remit and | went into it a little bit too deeply. And then all of sudden something unlocked in
me. | started hearing my ancestors. | could hear them crying and | could feel their pain. All my
female ancestors, | could feel them and | could feel all their children. | could hear them on their
voyage and | could feel all these people coming to me through all my reading. It started to affect
me and that was a problem.

Different experiences of psychosis

In 1986, at the age of 18, over a seven-month period | was admitted three times

to psychiatric hospital. Initially | had experienced sleep deprivation and was very confused,
holding some grandiose and paranoid beliefs. | believed the television and radio had interactive
messages for me. | also believed | had unknowingly been a spy and that the world was like a
combination of the books 1984, and Blade Runner. Nothing was as it appeared, with robotic
surveillance pets and sinister tracking devices.

| also saw familiar faces in strangers’ faces, which lead to further espionage theories. | believed
that | was in danger of losing my ability to think freely and spontaneously, that | would become
an automaton as | reached full adulthood. My concentration was extremely poor. | was in a high
state of vigilance, fear and tension, leading to psychosomatic chest pains. | also entertained other
more spiritual beliefs focussing on good and evil and having special powers of communication.
Due to having a family history of psychosis, it was easier for clinicians to quickly make a diagnosis
of schizophrenia. My parents were told | had schizophrenia and that | would need to take

medication for the rest of my life.

was constantly being bombarded by terrifying voices. | believed they were all powerful entities

said, another controlled what | ate and berated me with insults about my appearance.

1.2 Everyone's experiences are different

As with all human experiences, no one person's problems, or ways of coping with them, are exactly
the same as anyone else's. Some people have only one of these experiences, others have several.
Some people experience them on only one occasion, others from time to time (for example during
periods of stress), and others frequently.”

Many people do not come into contact with mental health services because they do not find their
experiences distressing." For example, many people hear voices talking to them when there is no-
one there, but the voices say relatively neutral, pleasant or even helpful things so this is not a
problem. Others develop ways of coping with their experiences on their own or with help from
people around them." Some people, however, are so distressed by their experiences that they seek
professional help. Some come to the attention of professionals because other people consider their
behaviour odd or worrying, or fear that it is putting the person or others at risk. Only these last
two groups of people are likely to come into contact with mental health services and to be
diagnosed as mentally ill.

1.3 Our different cultures

Our cultural background has a significant influence on what we experience, on how we interpret
those experiences and on the forms of help we are likely to find most useful. In the UK, European
beliefs and customs have been, and often still are implicitly assumed to be the norm. Some critics
argue that Western psychiatry and psychology have in the past sometimes viewed whole groups of
people as ‘pathological’ and acted as a form of ‘cultural imperialism.'® For example, the South
African psychologist Hendrik Verwoerd drew on eugenic theories to justify the racist policy of
apartheid when he was Prime Minister in the 1950s and 1960s". When one cultural group's
customs are implicitly assumed to be the norm, this can create an ‘us and them’ situation, where
cultural differences are misinterpreted and seen as problems or as ‘abnormal: This can apply to
subcultures too: for example, many white British people belong to religious or other groups which
elieve in the ability to communicate with the dead or with aliens. It is important for professionals
to maintain an attitude of respectful interest regarding the influence of culture on someone's
mental health problems and to avoid making assumptions. Culture might affect the nature of a
erson's experience (e.g. what kind of voices they hear), the meaning they make of it, or how they
describe and explain it. Sometimes, explanations used by people from minority ethnic backgrounds
or from particular subcultures (for example particular religious groups) might seem strange to
eople from majority cultures. This can sometimes lead to misinterpretation and unhelpful
responses from services. For example, someone from a particular religious group which believes in
the possibility of demon possession might believe that he or she is possessed.

n trying to help someone, we need to take into account not only their distress but also their
cultural background and circumstances. Often this can be complex: for example, in our multi-
cultural society many people identify with aspects of more than one culture. Racism is also a
roblem that those of us from black and minority ethnic backgrounds often face and, as a result,
many develop a degree of suspicion and wariness which is often a necessary survival mechanism.
Some commentators refer to such wariness as ‘healthy cultural paranoia’’”"’ but it may be
misinterpreted by professionals as a symptom of psychosis unless they take the person's social
context into account. Of course, racism may also in itself lead to mental health problems”

(see section 6.1).

Section 2: How common are these experiences?

Key points

These experiences are common: up to 10 per cent of the general population hear voices at
some point in their life, and very many people have beliefs that those around them find
strange.

Whilst these experiences are very distressing for some, others have similar experiences but
don't come into contact with mental health services because they don't find them particularly
distressing.

Some people see them as helpful or even as spiritual experiences.

As we explain below, the idea that these experiences are symptoms of mental illnesses is a
controversial one. Nevertheless, until recently much research published in academic journals was
based on this assumption, and so the only estimates available tend to be numbers of people who
have received a certain diagnosis. The past decade, however (since, indeed, the publication of our
first report),' has seen a steady increase in research exploring individual experiences such as
hearing voices.’ Researchers have also discovered that many people will not be counted in any
figures because they do not find their experiences distressing and therefore do not seek help from
mental health professionals.* However, much research still relies on psychiatric diagnoses given to
people who come into contact with services. Common diagnoses given to people who have these
sorts of experiences are schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Other terms that people might have
encountered are: paranoia, psychosis, psychotic illness, delusional disorder, schizoaffective disorder,
manic depression and psychotic depression.

2.1. How many people have ‘psychotic’ experiences? How many are given a
diagnosis of schizophrenia?
These experiences are quite common. Up to 10 per cent of people will at some point in their life
hear a voice talking to them when there is no-one there.* About one person in every hundred
receives a diagnosis of schizophrenia, so there are probably about 500,000 people in the UK who
have received the diagnosis. A similar number of people receive a diagnosis of bipolar disorder (also
known as manic depression).° As we will make clear later in this report, there is a very great deal of
variability in these figures - people's life circumstances affect both how likely they are to
experience certain problems, and also how likely they then are to receive a certain diagnosis.

2.2. People who do not use mental health services

A number of surveys have revealed that many people hear voices regularly. Most of these people
have never thought of themselves, or been thought of as mentally ill.° The main thing that appears
to distinguish them from those who come into contact with mental health services is the extent to
which they, or those around them, find the experience distressing or frightening. For example,
someone might go to a doctor if they or their family members are worried that their beliefs or

Understanding Psychosis 15


experiences might lead them to do something risky.’ Similarly, a large proportion of the general
population holds beliefs that others might consider unusual or paranoid, for example beliefs about
alien abduction, ghosts or telepathy.’ As we explain later, people's experiences vary in nature,
frequency and intensity, and appear to lie on a continuum. In other words, many of us occasionally
have puzzling experiences or hold some beliefs that others regard as peculiar or eccentric.
Relatively fewer of us have frequent or severe experiences, or beliefs that others find strange and
worrying.

People who have psychotic experiences but don't come into contact
with services

When you can't find a way out when you get into a complex situation, they (voices) help guide

you. You don't have to listen, you don't have to take their advice but it's nice that they give it
anyway.
Karen °

Many people who have these experiences feel that they are very significant in their lives. Some
people believe that they have religious or spiritual significance. Some explain them in terms of
supernatural or religious forces, or see them as giving them a deeper understanding of, or insight
into the world.”

Psychotic experiences and spiritual experiences

There are people who have developed a very positive relationship with the experience of hearing
voices, and have managed without any psychiatric treatment or support. They have adopted a
theoretical frame of reference (such as parapsychology, reincarnation, metaphysics, the collective
unconscious, or the spirituality of a higher consciousness) which connects them with others

rather than isolating them: they have found a perspective that offers them a language in which
to share their experiences. They enjoy a feeling of acceptance; their own rights are recognised,
and they develop a sense of identity which can help them to make constructive use of their
experiences for the benefit of themselves and others.

Section 3: Are these experiences best understood as
mental illness?

Key points

There is a debate about whether it is accurate and/or useful to think of experiences like
hearing voices as symptoms of mental illness. A psychological approach aims to understand
these experiences in the same way that we understand other thoughts and feelings.

As with other psychological problems, it makes sense to think of experiences like hearing
voices in terms of a continuum. Many people experience them occasionally or to a minor
degree, for example at times of stress, whereas for others they are more intense, enduring
and/or distressing.

Although many people find a diagnosis useful, in the arena of mental health diagnostic labels
say little about the likely cause of the experiences, and do not appear to describe consistent
patterns of problems relating to underlying biological abnormalities.

Introduction: The idea of mental illness

Experiences such as hearing voices or paranoia can sometimes be very distressing, puzzling and
worrying, and lead people to seek help. Traditionally, the framework within which help has been
offered has been a medical one, and the experiences have been seen as symptoms of mental
illnesses, for example schizophrenia. People often assume that mental illnesses ‘exist’ in the same
way that broken bones exist and can be revealed by medical tests in the same way. However, there
are many different theories as to what causes experiences such as hearing voices. The idea that
they are symptoms of illness, perhaps caused by some sort of chemical imbalance or other problem
in the brain, is just one of the theories. There is no objective biological test such as a blood test or
scan for diagnosing mental illness.

There is a vigorous debate about whether it is meaningful or useful to think of these experiences as
symptoms of mental illnesses. The main issues that are debated are:

e The extent to which psychotic experiences can be separated from normal ones
e The frequency with which ‘normal’ as well as ‘ill’ people experience these things
e The extent to which clinicians can agree on someone's diagnosis

e Whether mental illnesses are real ‘things’

e The advantages and disadvantages of seeing things as illness.

We will briefly explain each of these in turn.

Understanding Psychosis 7


3.1 Can psychotic experiences be separated from normal ones?

It is often assumed that there is a straightforward dividing line between ‘mental health’ and
‘mental illness’ (normality and abnormality) and that discrete, identified disease processes (for
example ‘schizophrenia’) are responsible for experiences such as hearing voices. However, recent
research suggests that this is not the case. Viewing experiences as symptoms of illnesses is only one
way of seeing them, and one that not everyone finds helpful.

here appears to be a continuum (a continuous line) between good and poor mental health that we
all move up and down along at different points in our lives. For example, at different times we may
e more or less anxious, suspicious or depressed. At points we probably all also have beliefs that
some others would find odd. Stressful life events are likely to have a significant impact on how we
think and feel,’ together with things like how much support we have, and what opportunities we
have to make sense of what is happening to us.

he tendency to have certain experiences also varies between individuals as part of a spectrum of
complex personal traits and characteristics in the population. On a number of dimensions, people
range from being conventionally ‘normal’ to quite unusual. This ‘continuum’ view is easily understood

y thinking about other common experiences such as anxiety. Individuals differ in terms of how
anxious they are in general. This may be an enduring characteristic of their personality, and is likely to
involve a combination of genetic factors and upbringing. Only a minority will ever experience extremes
of anxiety such as a series of panic attacks, which are recognised in the diagnostic textbooks as
justifying a diagnosis of an anxiety disorder. Similarly, the state of extreme suspiciousness known as
aranoia is an extension of the feelings of suspiciousness that we all feel from time to time.’ People

differ in this regard: we all know people with whom we have to be very careful what we do or say lest
they interpret it as an insult. Similarly, situations vary in their tendency to provoke suspiciousness.

We have all been in situations where it makes sense to be extra vigilant, for example walking home
alone late at night. In such situations it is easy to be frightened by even the most innocent things.

This ‘continuum model’ raises questions about traditional psychiatric diagnosis. These are discussed
below.

to make me feel even more uncomfortable around school... After university... probably as a
result of being isolated again, the thoughts began to come back. However, this time | began to be
under the impression that | had some sort of social handicap, similar to autism, and that people
could tell this just by the way that | did or didn't make eye contact with them. Consequently,
going out on the street became an ordeal because the more self-conscious | felt about my eye
contact, the more uncomfortable | felt when looking at people. Eventually, | was convinced that

when | was out on the street, everyone who saw me instantly knew | had some sort of social
handicap. It actually started to feel as if everyoody who met me pretended to treat me normally
and then laughed at me behind my back once I'd gone.

as heard voices ‘for as long as she can remember’ She hears the voices via her ears. The voices
are located both inside and outside her head. One voice began in childhood and is still present,
ut she also hears other voices. The initial voice talks to her in the second person. She
communicates with this voice, consulting it for the benefit of herself or her clients. Her voices
also talk among themselves. Although her voices are not actual voices she has heard in daily life,
she is not afraid of them and does not feel restricted by them. Rather, she feels that they are
rotective: they give her advice, comfort, and care... In her childhood, she was repeatedly
hysically and sexually abused, and her voices helped her to pull through difficult times... She
did not discuss her voices with other people until she was 34. She first talked about her voices
with her children after her divorce. She has never been in contact with a psychiatric service, and
ased on a Composite International Diagnostic Interview with a psychiatrist, she does not fulfil...
criteria for a mental disorder.

socially, although | have encountered feelings of anxiety and paranoia before in my life. If | am
with a friend, who maybe has a closer friend with them who does not talk to me as much in the
conversation, | always get the feeling that other person does not want me around, or is slightly
resentful of my presence. If someone | text does not text back, | assume it is because they do not
want to talk to me, and just ignore or delete my text. | also feel they must be annoyed with me
for bothering them, and wish | would leave them alone. When | am in shops or on the street, |
presume they are watching me to see if | do something strange, so they can secretly laugh to
themselves. Or if | have been in a group meeting, as soon as | walk away, they start making
comments about how | acted. | also think people are going to make ‘look at loner/saddo’
expressions when they see me on my own. So, do | suffer from paranoia, and/or low self-esteem?
| really want to do something about this, and talk to someone professional who | can trust. But |

3.2 Many ‘normal’ people have unusual experiences

Asecond finding also casts doubt on the assumption that experiences such as hearing voices are
necessarily part of an illness, namely this: such experiences do not appear to be that unusual. Many
healthy, well-functioning people sometimes have ‘abnormal’ experiences. For instance, many
people have heard a voice speaking when there was no-one there.’ Research also suggests that
nearly one in three people hold at least one belief that might be considered paranoid: ‘paranoia is
so common as to be almost normal:*

Only one in 50 of people who have ‘psychotic-like’ experiences would be classified by doctors as
meeting the criteria for a diagnosis of schizophrenia.° Extreme circumstances, such as sensory or
sleep deprivation, can lead to various disturbances, including paranoia and seeing visions, in people
who have never before had such experiences."° Some people who hear voices or see visions consider
them spiritually enriching." ° There is huge diversity in the way that experiences are understood
in different cultures. For example, cultures and subcultures vary with regard to whether particular
experiences are seen as signs of mental illness, as normal (religious and spiritual beliefs, for
example), or even as revered spiritual gifts (such as in the case of shamans)."* These findings
suggest that although psychotic experiences can, for some individuals, be extremely distressing and
disabling, other people see them as helpful and life enhancing." Of course, for many people they
can be both, either at different times or even at the same time: a ‘dangerous gift."

n addition to the finding that psychotic experiences are common and shade into ‘normal’ ones, a
third issue relevant to whether they are best understood as part of an illness is that of ‘diagnosis’
he attempt to classify psychological problems using systems of diagnosis has run into problems in
three areas: reliability (the extent to which clinicians can agree on a diagnosis), validity (the extent
to which the labels refer to real ‘things’ with common causes) and utility (the extent to which the
labels are useful, and to whom).

3.3 Are mental health diagnoses reliable - can clinicians agree?
Reliability is the likelihood that different clinicians will agree upon a diagnosis in any given case. In
recent years, much effort has gone into improving reliability, by increasing the number of
diagnoses available and by devising ‘tick box’ type lists of the criteria that have to be met for a
articular label to be applied. For example, overleaf are one manual's criteria for making a

diagnosis of schizophrenia:

20 Division of Clinical Psychology


Criteria for a diagnosis of schizophrenia taken from
a diagnostic manual (DSM-5)*”

All criteria (A - E) must be met:
(See below for an explanation of terms)

A. Characteristics: Two or more of the following, each present for a significant portion of time
during a 1-month period (or less if successfully treated). At least one of these must be (1), (2),
or (3):

1. Delusions

2. Hallucinations

3. Disorganised speech

4. Grossly disorganised or catatonic™ behaviour

5. Negative symptoms (i.e. diminished emotional expression or avolition

B. Social/occupational dysfunction: For a significant portion of the time since the onset of the
disturbance, level of functioning in one or more major areas, such as work, interpersonal
relations, or self-care, is markedly below the level achieved prior to the onset (or when the onset
is in childhood or adolescence, there is failure to achieve expected level of interpersonal,
academic or occupational functioning).

C. Duration: Continuous signs of the disturbance persist for at least 6 months. This

6-month period must include at least 1 month of symptoms (or less if successfully treated) that
meets Criterion A (i.e. active-phase symptoms) and may include periods of prodromal**™* or
residual symptoms. During these prodromal or residual periods, the signs of the disturbance may
be manifested by only negative symptoms or by two or more symptoms listed in Criterion A

present in an attenuated form (e.g. odd beliefs, unusual perceptual experiences).

D. Ruling out of other disorders: Schizoaffective disorder and depressive or bipolar disorder
with psychotic features have been ruled out because either

1) no depressive or manic episodes have occurred concurrently with the active-phase symptoms,
or

2) if mood episodes have occurred during active-phase symptoms, they have been present for a
minority of the total duration of the active and residual periods of the illness.

E. Attributes: The disturbance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance
(e.g. a drug of abuse, a medication) or another medical condition.

F. History: If there is a history of autism spectrum disorder or a communication disorder of
childhood onset, the additional diagnosis of schizophrenia is made only if prominent delusions
or hallucinations, in addition to the other required symptoms of schizophrenia, are also present
for at least a month (or less if successfully treated).

Key:

*The DSM (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of the American Psychiatric Association) is the American manual, the
ICD (International Classification of Diseases) is the international (World Health Organisation) manual. Both are
widely used.

* ‘catatonic ‘means very still and unresponsive

“*avolition’ means lack of motivation
“* ‘prodromal refers to less severe problems that predate more pronounced problems

Understanding Psychosis 21


Despite these efforts, reliability remains low for most diagnoses, at least in everyday clinical
practice where diagnoses are often made without detailed reference to the official manuals."®
Clinicians tend to have diagnostic ‘preferences’ and people are often given a range of diagnoses
during their contact with mental health services. Research confirms that usage varies between
different doctors, hospitals and countries. Even experienced clinicians who have been given extra
training in applying the criteria, only agree on a broad diagnostic category about 50 per cent of
the time. '°”

if the professionals would have reconsidered in the way they did, had my mother had less

Raza Griffiths ”

3.4 Are mental health diagnoses meaningful?
Do they refer to real ‘things’?

The tendency has always been strong to believe that whatever has a name must be an entity or
being, having an independent existence of its own. And if no entity answering to the name could
be found, men did not for that reason suppose that none existed, but imagined that it was

something peculiarly abstruse and mysterious.

John Stuart Mill (1869) 7

3.4.1 Naming something doesn't make it real

Experiences such as hearing voices are real experiences for the person having them, and can lead to
very real distress. However, this does not mean that they are necessarily symptoms of real ‘illnesses’,
for example schizophrenia. Giving something a name, and even being very clear about its

22 Division of Clinical Psychology


definition, doesn't mean that it necessarily exists in reality. Most people would agree on how to
identify a unicorn, for example, even though they are mythical rather than real creatures. The
problem is that the existence of the label can give the misleading impression of the existence of
the ‘thing: As psychiatrist Jim Van Os puts it: ‘The complicated, albeit ultimately meaningless,
Greek term suggests that schizophrenia really is a “thing”, i.e. a “brain disease” that exists as such in
Nature. This is a false suggestion.” The extent to which a label refers to a meaningful entity in the
real world is sometimes called ‘validity: Dr Thomas Insel, Director of the National Institute of
Mental Health in the US, is critical of the current diagnostic approach: ‘Patients deserve better. The
weakness is its lack of validity: So to be clear: the experiences and distress are very real, but the
explanation - that there is an illness called ‘schizophrenia’ causing them - may not be true.

3.4.2 What a diagnostic label does not tell you

We normally expect medical diagnoses to tell us something about what has caused a certain
problem, what the person can expect in future (‘prognosis’) and what is likely to help. However, this
is not the case with mental health ‘diagnoses’, which rather than being explanations are just ways
of categorising experiences based on what people tell clinicians. The Diagnostic and Statistical
Manual of the American Psychiatric Association (DSM) explicitly states that its categories say
nothing about cause - in its own words it is ‘neutral with respect to theories of aetiology.” For
example, someone who says that they are hearing voices might be given a diagnosis of
schizophrenia. Since this says nothing about cause, it makes little sense to say that the person
hears the voices ‘because of' the schizophrenia. An analogy with physical medicine might be a label
such as ‘idiopathic pain’, which merely means that a person is reporting pain, but a cause of that
pain cannot be identified. Turning to ‘prognosis’, as we explain below outcome is very variable. In
terms of what can help, the same drugs and psychological therapies are used for a range of
diagnoses, and two people with the same diagnosis often find very different things helpful. This
suggests that diagnostic categories do not reflect ‘real’ categories or differences between people:
they don't ‘carve nature at the joints.”°

3.4.3 Experiences are on a continuum and don't fall into neat categories

Another relevant finding is the one mentioned above, namely that many people hear voices or hold
beliefs that others regard as bizarre, but do not have a diagnosis and would not meet the criteria
for one.”’ Whereas the traditional view has been that some people have an illness (a ‘thing’ called
psychosis or schizophrenia), and others don't, as we explained above; a more helpful and accurate
view is probably to see experiences as on a continuum (a line joining two ends of a scale). People
who rarely have such experiences, or who find them helpful, might be at one end of the
continuum. At the other end would be those who have very frequent, intense and distressing
experiences. Some of these people might need considerable help and support, and some see
themselves as ill. This approach underlies a recent initiative to classify problems for research
purposes, the ‘Research Domain Criteria’ (RDoC).” This attempts to develop a new system of
classification based on measuring various things which are each continuous, but might affect the
likelihood of someone experiencing problems, for example how quickly they tend to become
emotionally aroused or to calm down.

Understanding Psychosis 23


3.4.4 The ever-expanding reach of mental health diagnoses

Over time, the list of psychiatric diagnoses has grown and grown, and some have argued that the
list is now so exhaustive that we would all fit one category or other. This is one reason that the
newest version of the diagnostic manual, DSM 5, has been so controversial.” The diagnosis of
schizophrenia is particularly so. For example, there is evidence that young black men are particularly
likely to receive a diagnosis of schizophrenia and that this might relate partly to racism (and
perhaps also gender and class discrimination) both in society and within services.°*"**° Dr Jonathan
Metzl points out that there was in the past even a specific diagnosis of ‘negro schizophrenia’ and
that in the 1960s many young men taking part in the civil rights movement were labelled with
‘protest psychosis:***° Professor Suman Fernando has pointed out that ‘excessive labelling with
schizophrenia links up with excessive stop and search, prison, and school exclusion’*°

3.4.5 Has the idea of schizophrenia arisen as a result of the ‘Clinician’s Illusion’?
Evidence is accumulating that the idea of an illness called schizophrenia might be the result of
clinicians experiencing a phenomenon called ‘Berkson’s Bias’ *’** - in other words, concluding that
two things are related when in fact, they both independently affect the likelihood of someone
seeking help from services. For example, many people sometimes experience one or more of the
following: finding it hard to look after themselves, feeling desperate, confused or disoriented,
hearing voices, thinking suspicious or paranoid thoughts. There is increasing evidence that, contrary

to what clinicians have traditionally believed, these experiences are often unrelated.” Those who
experience only one or two of these problems are unlikely to seek help from services. Only people
who experience several of them and to a severe degree, are likely to end up seeking help from
services and so receive a diagnosis.“ *' This is what underlies the so-called ‘clinician's illusion’,”
namely the idea that people who have one of these experiences (hearing voices, say) also tend to
have many of the others, to be very distressed, and to have ongoing problems.

3.5 The advantages and disadvantages of seeing things as
mental illness

The previous sections suggest that the ‘illness’ view does not always accord with what we know
from science. It is certainly clear that it is only one way of understanding experiences such as
hearing voices, rather than the only way. So the question arises: is it the most helpful way?

Thinking of things as an illness can have some advantages. It gives us a way of talking about
difficult things and a framework for offering help: time off work with sick pay or benefits if
needed, and access to services. For people involved in planning services or efforts at prevention,
diagnoses provide a way of talking about groups of people when we are looking at where and
when certain problems tend to occur, or what might help. They are also currently used in decisions
about allocation of resources in health services. Some people welcome a diagnosis because it
implies that they are not alone in what they are experiencing.” Some are concerned that if others
don't see them as ill, they might blame them (or perhaps their family) for their problems and see
them as lacking in willpower or determination to get over them. This has been called the ‘blame or
brain’ dilemma and is addressed below.

People who find a diagnosis helpful and think of themselves as
having an illness

| think | prefer my illness having a name because it makes me feel less lonely, and | know that
there are other people experiencing my kind of misery. And that people live through my illness
and make a meaningful existence with it. But | also have to be careful not to adopt the sick role,
since | know | would just give up if | did that.

Karin Falk *

When someone confronts you with the line ‘you're ill’ it's easy to reject it out of hand and
dismiss it totally. But denial can be extremely damaging. | see my first six years in the system as
being in limbo. Acceptance of my illness was a turning point - the start of my path to wellness.
It is important to understand that denial of the illness can be a natural reaction and a normal
defence mechanism to a very painful truth. Society has a dim view of mental illness and the
stigma around it is very powerful. For me, denial was my way of coping, of staying normal. It was
a way of dealing with the initial trauma of breaking down. The trouble with not accepting is that
you also reject treatment. You refuse medication, fight confinement and rebel, or worse - turn
on those trying to help you. This behaviour gets you nowhere, and just makes things worse. By
accepting treatment | could actively seek the right medication, access support, and turn my life
around. Without acceptance you remain trapped in the delusion that nothing's wrong. I've seen
many stuck there - a bad place to be.

There is a point where it becomes what we call an illness - we don't function properly and

we are experiencing very unusual things and reacting very unusually... The problem lies ...

in what we attach to the ideas of illness. If the concept of illness was extended from biology to
include our emotional/spiritual/thinking and meaning-making faculties we would have a holistic
approach which would offer more.

However, in other ways thinking in terms of illness can be unhelpful. Some people feel that, overall,
the idea of mental illness does more harm than good. Interviews with people who had been given a
diagnosis of psychosis suggested that many felt labelled in society as a ‘mental patient’ or
‘schizophrenic: They felt that the diagnosis had disempowered them and led to them being
excluded from mainstream society.” Similarly, a review concluded that being seen as mentally ill
causes more distress for many people than their original problems.” People seen as mentally ill are
often avoided, treated harshly and subject to discrimination.* For example, although having a job
can be very important in people's recovery, employers are less likely to offer work to someone if
they know that they have a psychiatric diagnosis” and unemployment rates for people with a
‘psychotic’ diagnosis are very high.” Reviews of the available evidence” suggest that viewing
distress as ‘an illness like any other’ can actually increase prejudice and discrimination.” Some
writers have suggested that presenting problems as an illness has the effect of making them seem
mysterious and unpredictable, and the people experiencing the problems as ‘almost another
species.*

Receiving a diagnosis can also have negative psychological effects on the person, for example
leading to feelings of hopelessness and decreased confidence. It can give the message that people
can do little to overcome their problems except to ‘keep taking the tablets: It can divert attention
from the possible meaning or positive aspects that the experiences might have for the person.”

It can also deflect attention away from underlying social and emotional problems that could
otherwise be addressed in a restorative way, for example the aftermath of adversities like poverty,
discrimination, childhood abuse or assault. Importantly, the way that diagnoses appear to
summarise the nature and causes of someone's experience can prevent workers from asking about,
and helping, the person to deal with the events and emotions that may in reality underlie the
problems.

People who find ‘diagnoses’ unhelpful and do not think of
themselves as having an illness

For a number of years, | accepted the medical model as a framework of understanding...

But | gradually came to appreciate drawbacks to the framework. My reading suggested the
model might not stand up scientifically. The emphasis on distress as illness not only encouraged
a resort to exclusively physical treatments (drugs, ECT) but pushed to one side any consideration
of the content and meaning of my crisis episodes. Thinking of myself as having a chronic and
incurable illness robbed me of power and agency and confined me within an essentially negative
category. By the time | was entering my second decade of service use, the medical model, which |
had initially found reassuring, seemed increasingly unsatisfactory, without the capacity to
encompass the complexity of my interior or exterior life and give it positive value. As a result, |
began to actively explore frameworks that better met my needs.

3.6 Recent recommendations to move away from using diagnoses

In view of the problems with diagnoses, many researchers and clinicians are moving away from
using them, and recent high-profile reports have recommended this.*

After an extensive review of the evidence, the Schizophrenia Commission, despite its name,
advocated ‘extreme caution in making a diagnosis of schizophrenia as it can generate stigma and
unwarranted pessimism: There is an ongoing ‘Inquiry into the Schizophrenia Label’
www.schizophreniainquiry.org) which has reported that many people feel that they have been
armed by being given the diagnosis. Many felt that it had caused them more distress than their
original difficulties.

he British Psychological Society (BPS) has stated that ‘clients and the general public are negatively
affected by the continued and continuous medicalisation of their natural and normal responses to
their experiences; responses which undoubtedly have distressing consequences ... but which do not
reflect illnesses so much as normal individual variation... This misses the relational context of
roblems and the undeniable social causation of many such problems.” The BPS Division of Clinical
Psychology (DCP) has explicitly criticised the current systems of psychiatric diagnosis such as
DSM-5 and ICD-10." It has suggested that we need ‘a paradigm shift in relation to the
experiences that these diagnoses refer to, towards a conceptual system not based on a ‘disease’
model.”

his suggestion has attracted widespread support and a ‘Global Summit on Diagnostic Alternatives’
as been set up.” The DCP has suggested one alternative for use in clinical practice: an approach
called ‘collaborative formulation’? which is described in Section 8 of this report. Formulations
explore the personal meaning of the events, relationships and social circumstances of someone's
ife, and of their current experiences or distress. The person experiencing the difficulty works
together with the professional to develop a hypothesis, or best guess, which can provide a basis for
inding a way forward.” Unlike a diagnosis, formulation is based on the assumption that however
extreme, unusual or overwhelming the nature of that distress ‘...at some level it all makes sense.”
Formulations are an answer to the ‘brain or blame’ dilemma mentioned above: they make sense of
roblems in a way that neither implies that people are to blame, nor that their problems are ‘all in
the mind: As we will go on to discuss, a huge range of factors contribute to distress, and there are
no simple causes. Each person's problems, and the causes of their problems, are different. Perhaps
the analogy of poverty is helpful - all kinds of people find themselves in financial difficulty, for all
kinds of reasons. We wouldn't diagnose an ‘illness’ of poverty, we wouldn't assume that the causes
are the same in every case, and we wouldn't assume that people are always to blame for their
financial troubles. Each case is different, each case is a serious problem that needs to be
understood and responded to, but neither ‘diagnosis’ nor blame is appropriate.

28 Division of Clinical Psychology


Section 4: How do these experiences affect people's lives?

Key points:

here is huge variability in people's experiences: whilst some people find their experiences very
distressing, others are relatively untroubled by them and some people even experience them as
jositive.

Whilst some people have distressing and disabling experiences for many years, many others
experience psychosis only once in their lives, often at a time of particular stress.

Even if people continue to hear voices or hold unusual beliefs, they may nevertheless lead very
appy and successful lives. Sometimes a tendency to ‘psychosis’ can be associated with
articular talents or abilities.

he idea that psychosis often leads to violence is a myth.

he variability in how people's experiences affect them makes it vital for mental health services
to address all aspects of people's wellbeing rather than just attempting to reduce ‘symptoms:

4.1 Variability in outcomes

As mentioned above, many people who hear voices or see visions — perhaps two out of three - are
not troubled by them and do not seek help from mental health services.' Even for those whose
experiences are distressing and lead to contact with services, the outlook is much better than is
commonly assumed. About half will experience problems on one occasion only and then recover
completely. Only a minority experience on-going difficulties:’ for those people, of course, it is vital
that long-term, open-ended, high-quality support is available. Outcomes also vary between
countries.’ A recent review concluded that ‘the idea that schizophrenia is a progressive brain
disease is not supported by the weight of longitudinal neuroimaging and cognitive studies...

[this idea] has contributed to undue pessimism among mental health professionals:*

| work four days a week in a professional job; | own my own house and live happily with my
partner and pets. Occasionally | hear voices - for example when | have been particularly stressed
or tired, or | have seen visions after a bereavement. Knowing that many people hear voices and
live well, and that some cultures see these experiences as a gift, helps me to never catastrophise
or to worry that it may be the start of a breakdown. Although | am lucky that the experiences
have never been as upsetting as some people's, if someone had told me it was madness | could

have got into a vicious cycle and struggled to get out.

4.2 Which outcomes matter?

Recovery is about building a meaningful and satisfying life, as defined by the person themselves,
whether or not there are ongoing or recurring symptoms or problems.

Geoff Shepherd, Jed Boardman & Mike Slade °

Outcome is a complex phenomenon. Things might improve for someone - or remain difficult - on a
number of dimensions that could be relatively independent of each other.’ Examples might include:

e ‘Clinical’ outcome - whether or not someone continues to have the particular distressing
experiences or symptoms.
e ‘Personal’ outcome - the extent to which someone is able to make meaningful sense of their

experience in a way that others can respect, and to find a way of integrating the experiences
into their life. The extent to which their distress reduces and they are satisfied with their life.

e ‘Social’ outcome - the extent to which someone has valued roles within their community and
has good housing, income and relationships.

People who continue to have severe and distressing experiences may lead happy and successful

ives in all other respects, such as work and relationships. Many people find that the hardest part of
recovery is overcoming prejudice, discrimination, lowered expectations and the pressure to sub-
scribe to a ‘sick role’’ This can be particularly hard for people who in addition to experiencing psy-
chosis are also members of devalued or disadvantaged groups in terms of ethnicity, gender, sexual
reference, age or social class.’ A Mental Health Foundation study suggested for example that
recovery approaches focusing on getting black women back into employment and education are
not going to be effective unless they are also equipped to deal with the oppressions that they face
in society”?

he important outcomes are those that the person themselves sees as significant. ‘Getting better’
means different things to different people; for some, reducing the frequency or intensity of the
experiences is most important, but for others it is other things - improved relationships,
confidence, self-worth, greater engagement in work and activities, being able to cope with
everyday life, material wellbeing, physical health,” hope for the future and a sense of purpose." It
is important that measures of outcome capture these aspects as well as reduction in ‘symptoms.”

4.3 Influences on outcome

Five processes appear to be particularly important for recovery and wellbeing: connecting to the
world outside of oneself (e.g. supportive relationships, spirituality), hope, a positive identity beyond
being a patient, finding meaning in life, and empowerment (learning what helps and so gaining
control, and having the right opportunities)."*'®

Recovery rates are better during periods of full employment compared with periods of economic
recession.” People who find work tend to do better,"* especially when they choose the work and
have control over it, when it uses their skills and is valued by others.’°* Encountering prejudice and
discrimination, either on mental health grounds or on other grounds such as ethnicity, class,
gender or sexuality can also be a significant obstacle to recovery.”"” Additionally, regardless of
affluence, more people experience mental health problems in countries where the gap between
rich and poor is greatest.” Again, this suggests that being valued by others, feeling (and being
treated as) equal to those around you and having control over your own life are important.

People who have supportive relationships tend to do better than those who have less support or
more stressful relationships.” * In particular, people tend to do less well if their partners or family

Sam's story

Sam first heard distressing voices in her teens after being raped. She coped by using illegal
drugs. She came to the attention of services after hitting the man who had raped her. She found
hope through reading other people's recovery stories, making sense of her own experiences and
taking control of her life. She and others believed in her recovery and focused on her strengths,
and she was able to take advantage of work opportunities that arose. She wrote about her story
So that readers could gain hope and progress with their own recovery journey. Hers has
continued and she has not used medication or mental health services for ten years.

| got a job. Work has helped me. It's given me confidence to know | could do this.

4.4 The myth that psychosis leads to violence

In contrast to media stereotypes, in reality few people who experience paranoia or hear distressing
voices ever hurt anyone else. It is very slightly more common for people with psychiatric diagnoses
to commit violent crimes than for those without such diagnoses. However, the difference in rates is
extremely small: far less, for example, than the increased risk associated with any one of: being
male, being young, having consumed alcohol or used street drugs, or having been violent in the
past.” It is also possible that even the slight apparent difference is actually due to the fact that
people who have been violent are more likely than others to come into contact with the authorities
and therefore to be assessed and receive a diagnosis. Most violence is committed by people who
have never been in contact with mental health services and the overwhelming majority of mental
health service users have never been violent.”* In those cases where somebody with a history of
using mental health services is violent, the usual risk factors for violence (gender, alcohol or drug
use, a past history of violent behaviour) are usually more important factors to consider than the
mental health issues. Moreover, specific diagnoses like schizophrenia do not predict dangerous-
ness.” The reason that people associate a diagnosis with violence is most likely a result of negative
and stereotyped media reporting about mental health.” A survey found that homicide and crime
were the most frequent themes in media coverage of mental health.” Films and television dramas
also often depict people with mental health problems as violent and unpredictable. * However, as
a result of people's fear and prejudice, mental health service users are much more likely than others
to be victims of violence.*®

32 Division of Clinical Psychology


This is particularly the case for black service users, who can sometimes experience double
discrimination. Both the public and mental health professionals are prone to overestimating the
likelihood that young black men in particular will be violent.” As a result they often get a very
poor deal from services and are more likely than others to be locked up or medicated against their
will." One result can be a ‘circle of fear’ where people are afraid of services, avoid them
even in times of crisis, and are then even more likely to experience coercion, for example being
‘sectioned’ under the Mental Health Act.

Part 2: Causes

Why do so many people have these experiences and when
do they become distressing?

Understanding Psychosis 35


Introduction to Part 2

As with other human characteristics, there is an ongoing debate about what causes the tendency
to have ‘psychotic’ experiences. Life events and circumstances, inherited tendencies and the way
we see the world and interpret events can all play a role. It's important to bear in mind that the
‘causes’ of complex human thoughts and feelings are different from the ‘causes’ of simpler things
such as chemical reactions. We need to be careful in the way we think here. In particular, although
there are commonalities, different combinations of causes are likely to be relevant for different
people, and to interact with each other. There is no ‘one size fits all’ explanation. Different people
experience these things for different reasons. People who have themselves experienced psychosis
hold a variety of views about the nature and causes of their difficulties.’ Since no professional is in
a position to know for sure exactly which elements combined together to cause problems for a
particular person, it is important to respect people's own views.

An enormous range of things have been proposed as possible causes of psychotic experiences.’ As
every thought is both a brain-based event and a human experience, it can be impossible to
separate out different types of causes. It can be helpful to think in terms of ‘levels of explanation’
rather than causes. For example, a thought can be explained in terms of its brain chemistry (which
chemicals are involved?), its psychology (e.g. do people have different ‘thinking styles’ in different
moods?) or its social context (e.g. what has happened to which the thought is a reaction?). An
explanation might link these levels but one does not ‘cause’ the other any more than, say, the
wiring of a television ‘causes’ the plot of EastEnders. We need to understand many different things
in order to explain why people spend hours watching a flickering screen.

Traditionally, the search for causes of psychosis has focused mainly on genetics and on aspects of
brain structure and functioning. Psychologists have also looked at the way that people interpret
information and their ‘thinking styles: More recently, research has focused on how both of these
aspects might relate to the circumstances of people's lives and things that have happened to them.
Over the last 15 years or so, we have discovered much more about the role that life events can play
for many people, particularly deprivation and trauma. It seems that, as with other problems such as
anxiety and depression, a major cause of many psychotic experiences lies in things that have
happened in people's lives, and how these have affected them.

Section 5: Biology - our brains

Key points

Every human experience has biological, psychological and social aspects. Experiences such as
earing voices or holding unusual beliefs are the result of complex interactions between the
circumstances of our lives, the way we see the world and interpret events, and our biological
makeup.

For each person, there will be a different pattern of causes: for some people, constitutional
actors will play a significant role, whereas for others the most important causes will be the
circumstances and events of their lives.

here is a constant interaction between these different aspects of our experiences, so it doesn't
make sense to look for a single cause of any experience.

o date we do not have firm evidence for any specific biological mechanism underlying
sychotic experiences.

Introduction

t is widely assumed that psychosis has a biological cause. It is in pharmaceutical companies’
interests to promote the idea that schizophrenia is a brain disease: Eli Lilly's website states that
‘schizophrenia is a ... neurological disorder, believed to be caused by a biochemical imbalance in the
rain:' Although often reported uncritically by the media, this view is hotly debated.’ It has been
subject to increasing challenge over recent years, as it has become clear that our experiences, our
sychology and our biological make-up all play a role, and all affect each other. The precise
combination of causes will be different for each person. No professional can ever say with certainty
what has caused one particular individual to have certain experiences. Biological factors can play
their part, and there are clearly cases where they are important, for example when someone has a
sychotic experience when they are physically ill or have taken particular drugs.

However, despite all the research that has been done, there is still little or no evidence that for the
majority of people, a problem in the brain can be considered the main cause of psychotic
experiences, or that there is a brain disease called schizophrenia. Many neurological and
iochemical pathways in the brain are likely to be involved in experiences such as hearing voices.

However, this is also the case for all other human experiences. For example, our brain chemistry is
different when we are happy from when we are sad. ‘Cause’ can also work both ways: chemical
changes in the brain could lead us to see the world differently, but equally things that happen to
us can cause changes in the brain. The undoubted existence of biological aspects to distressing
experiences does not in itself tell us anything about what causes them, or justify categorising them
as brain diseases.

Understanding Psychosis 37


5.1 Genetics

The tendency to hear voices or hold unusual beliefs sometimes ‘runs in families’ and, as with other
characteristics and experiences, genetics can certainly play a role. However, the methodology and
results of studies relating to genetic factors in ‘schizophrenia’ are the subject of much debate in
professional journals.**°°7 It is impossible completely to disentangle genetics from environmental
factors such as upbringing and life circumstances (in other words to separate ‘nature’ from
‘nurture’).

Research looking at the possible role of genetics often compares identical and non-identical twins,
or biological and adoptive relatives of people who have been given a diagnosis of schizophrenia.
Current research also uses a technique called ‘GWAS" or ‘genome-wide association study’ This
technique is most often used in the field of physical health to look more precisely at genetic
differences between people with or without a particular disease.

These techniques have identified certain genetic characteristics that appear to be more common
among people who have certain mental health diagnoses.’ Such research is sometimes heralded in
the media as a breakthrough” which might one day ‘uncover the genetic basis of mental
disorders." However, we need to interpret such claims with caution. The genetic similarities which
the studies identify are associated not with one ‘disorder’ but with a wide range of characteristics,
for example the tendency to be emotional, or problems with concentration. We should remember
that genes code for proteins, not experiences. For some people they can play an important role, but
only as part (perhaps 6 per cent, according to one recent study") of the complex web of interacting
factors that contribute to a particular experience. That is very different to the claim sometimes
made that ‘schizophrenia is a genetic disorder’

Whilst in the past researchers were looking for a causal gene, it now appears that genetic risk is
much less specific. There may be many heritable characteristics which each increase the likelihood
of someone experiencing psychosis if they are exposed to particular life events. An example might
be a sensitive temperament. In many circumstances sensitivity is of course a good thing," but all
else being equal, people who are particularly sensitive might be more likely to experience psychosis
if they experience hardship, abuse or trauma."*

Another new and interesting area of research concerns ‘epigenetics. This is the study of how parts
of our genetic mechanisms are ‘switched on’, ‘turned up’ or ‘turned down’ by the things that
happen in our lives. So, for instance, a gene that is responsible for the production of a specific
protein may be more or less active, so produce more or less of that protein, in different
environmental conditions. The gene is still there, but it may be more or less active depending on
the environment.

In summary: when we are trying to understand any one person's experience, genetics might be one
part of the jigsaw. But because the genetic elements of this jigsaw are common to many different
experiences, and also interact with environmental factors, it doesn't make sense to single out them
out as ‘the’ cause, or even the most important one.

38 Division of Clinical Psychology


5.2 Neurochemical theories

t is often suggested that psychosis might be caused by an imbalance or difference in brain
chemicals (neurotransmitters). Some evidence for this argument comes from the effects of drugs.
Firstly, people who use a lot of cannabis appear to be more at risk of developing psychosis,"°
although it is not always easy to separate the effects of the drug from the circumstances that may
ave led people to seek solace in drug use in the first place. Secondly, neuroleptic medication,
which can ‘dampen down’ experiences such as hearing voices, also affects neurotransmitters.
Further evidence comes from brain imaging studies, which suggest that there might be differences
in the way some chemicals behave in the brains of some people who have been diagnosed with
schizophrenia." There are over 100 neurotransmitters in the brain, but so far researchers have
concentrated on three: dopamine, serotonin and glutamate.

he dopamine hypothesis - the theory that psychosis may result from differences in the way the
rain produces and handles the neurotransmitter dopamine - is often put forward as a biochemical
explanation. This suggestion has been extensively researched over the last 30 years, and three types
of evidence have been put forward in support of it. Firstly, some brain imaging studies using

injections of a dopamine-related chemical have suggested that there may be differences in the way
the chemical behaves in the brains of some people with a diagnosis of schizophrenia when
compared to people without a diagnosis.” Secondly, many neuroleptic (‘anti-psychotic’) drugs are
thought to affect dopamine." These drugs can sometimes induce Parkinsonism - abnormal
movements similar to those seen in Parkinson's disease. Parkinsonism is known to be related to
problems with dopamine mechanisms. Thirdly, drugs such as amphetamines, which increase
dopamine production, can also produce psychotic-like experiences.

Some of the newer neuroleptics affect a different neurotransmitter - serotonin. Research into the
possible role of serotonin,'® and other neurotransmitters such as glutamate,” has so far been
inconclusive. *

It is important to remember that the function of all neurotransmitters is to convey information.
Dopamine, for example, is used in the pathway which communicates social threat or fear. It would
therefore be surprising if it were not involved in the experience of, say, paranoid anxiety. We do not
yet know the details of these kinds of mechanisms, but it is at least plausible to suggest that
differences between people in terms of their brain chemicals, might be at least partly a result of
different life experiences which have led certain pathways to be more active. So even if a reliable
relationship were found between a biochemical characteristic and a particular experience, for
example hearing voices, this would not necessarily tell us anything about cause and effect. It may
be the case that the experience leads to biochemical changes rather than the other way around. It
is also possible that some third factor, for example the medication that people are taking, might be
responsible. Our knowledge of the biochemistry of psychotic experiences (and indeed of the
biochemistry of most other forms of human experience) is very limited, and we are not in a
position to make any firm statements about biochemical causes. The complex jigsaw of factors
involved in experiences such as hearing voices inevitably involves brain chemicals, but it is
important to remember that they are only one part of the jigsaw rather than ‘the’ cause.

Understanding Psychosis 39


5.3 Brain structure and function

Research has also examined the possible role of brain structure and function.” For example, recent
brain imaging studies have examined patterns of blood flow and electrical activity in the brain.”

Some studies have found differences in structure (e.g. volume of ‘grey matter’ in certain areas) and
function (e.g. more or fewer signals appearing to pass between different areas) when average
results from a group of people with a diagnosis of schizophrenia are compared with those from a
group of people without the diagnosis. Some of these differences, for example in the size of
structures known as the hippocampus and amygdala, appear to pre-date formal diagnosis.”
However, these findings need to be interpreted with caution for a number of reasons:

e There is always a big overlap between the groups - it is not possible to look at someone's
results and say with confidence whether or not they have experienced psychosis.

e Most studies compare groups of people with and without a diagnosis of schizophrenia. If, as
suggested above, ‘diagnosis’ is inherently problematic in this area, then arguably we can
conclude little from comparing these two groups. As we explained above, people who end up
receiving a diagnosis, using services for a significant time, and being included in research
studies are often those who have difficulties or needs in a number of areas. They are not
typical of everyone who has psychotic experiences such as voice hearing.

e In most studies the people with a history of ‘psychosis’ have also taken powerful medication
for many years. Recent evidence suggests that this can cause changes in the structure of the
brain, for example a reduction in its overall size.”

e Finally, it is important to remember that life experiences, distress and trauma may themselves
leave physical traces on the brain, as well as the other way round. A striking example of this
is the finding that physical changes can be seen in an area of the brain called the
hippocampus” as London taxi-drivers learn ‘the knowledge’, building up their mental map of
the streets of the capital. Recent research has suggested that the reason for any differences
in the brains of people who experience ‘psychosis’ might often be early traumatic events in
their lives, rather than differences that they were born with.” For example, the ‘social
defeat theory of schizophrenia’ suggests that repeated experiences of being disadvantaged
and socially excluded can lead to sensitivity in the dopamine pathways in the brain.”

A complete list of all the factors that have been identified as potential causes of psychosis would
cover every aspect of biological functioning. However, there is no conclusive evidence that
biological abnormalities are the main cause of this or indeed any other mental health problem. As
the chair of the task force that produced DSM-5" (a widely used diagnostic manual) stated: ‘In the
future, we hope to be able to identify disorders using biological and genetic markers... we've been
telling patients for several decades that we are waiting for biomarkers [a measurable characteristic
indicative of a particular disease]. We're still waiting!”

5.4 Conclusions

For some of us, aspects of our biological makeup appear to contribute to the likelihood that we
will have an experience such as hearing voices. However this does not necessarily imply that we
should think of psychosis as a biological illness. Despite decades of research, no specific biological
mechanism has been identified as the main cause of psychotic experiences. The relevant aspects of
someone's biological makeup are likely to be more general, for example a sensitive constitution.
Whilst biological factors might be very important for some people, for others they may play little if
any role: for example, we might all have psychotic experiences if subject to certain types of stress.
As with other complex human experiences, there are many ‘causes’: our biological makeup
constantly interacts with both our personal characteristics and our environment. The complex
reasons for one person's experiences may have little in common with the causes of someone else's.

However, the widespread acceptance of the idea that diagnoses such as schizophrenia refer to
biological illnesses has led to a situation where people often assume that experiences such as
hearing voices always arise from a problem within the brain. As a result workers have often not
tried to understand the experiences in the context of the person's life, or prioritised talking to the
person about their experiences. The ‘brain disease’ idea has also contributed to a climate in which
the main, or only, treatment tends to be medication. This in turn has meant that other approaches
to helping, such as talking treatments, have often been unavailable. It has also diverted resources
away from the circumstances of people's lives, not only in the way that we try to help people in
distress, but also in research and in efforts at prevention.” *

Section 6: Life experiences and how they affect us

Key points

The role that life experiences can play is becoming clearer. Psychosis can often be a response to
the things that happen in our lives, particularly traumatic or very stressful events.

People who are poor or live in unequal societies are more likely than others to develop mental
health problems. Psychosis is no exception.

Introduction

Over recent years it has become clear that psychosis can sometimes be a response to the things
that happen in our lives, particularly traumatic events. In other words:
‘Bad things happen and can drive you crazy:'

6.1 Life events and trauma

We all deal with many stressful events in our lives - divorce, rejection, redundancy, bitter
disappointments, bereavement and various kinds of failure. Even positive events - winning the
lottery, for example - can be stressful. Some of us have more than most to deal with, in the shape of
poverty, bullying, family problems, loneliness, abuse or trauma. Those of us from black and minority
ethnic (BME) backgrounds often experience ongoing and routine racism, insults and discrimination,
the effects of which can build up over time? until things reach a crisis point. Some of us have been
traumatised by warfare or torture or have experienced great hardship as refugees.** Much evidence
has now accumulated to suggest that, like other mental health problems, ‘psychosis’ can be a
reaction to such stressful events and life circumstances, particularly abuse or other forms of
trauma.°° For example, voices may relate to previous events which have left difficult feelings and
memories that need to be explored and resolved. All communities remember their history, and
sometimes people's experiences (voices, for example) echo past forms of persecution such as slavery.
A review found that between half and three-quarters of psychiatric inpatients had been either
physically or sexually abused as children.’ Experiencing multiple childhood traumas appears to give
approximately the same risk of developing psychosis as smoking does for developing lung cancer.’

Often the content of people's experiences is related to the nature of the trauma. For example, a
survivor of childhood abuse struggling with negative feelings about themselves might hear the
voice of a former abuser telling them they are worthless, and this might further reinforce their low
self-esteem. Trauma survivors are often troubled by flashbacks and intrusive images, or may
‘dissociate’ - mentally leave the situation, cut off or ‘blank out. Many refugees hear voices or
experience visions related to the traumas they have been through.’ It is becoming clear that there
is much more overlap than was previously thought between these trauma-related experiences and
those that have been thought of as psychosis.” This overlap is currently the focus of much
research," and an editorial in the British Journal of Psychiatry has suggested that ‘the
implications of our having finally taken seriously the causal role of childhood adversity are

42 Division of Clinical Psychology


profound." Some psychologists are reaching the conclusion that psychosis is often no more and no
less than a natural reaction to traumatic events. For example one recent paper suggested that
‘there is growing evidence that the experiences service users report ... are, in many cases, a natural
reaction to the abuses they have been subjected to. There is abuse and there are the effects of
abuse. There is no additional ‘psychosis’ that needs explaining.”

Life events
After being almost killed by my ex-boyfriend when | was 16 | have had OCD. | have also
developed paranoia about someone trying to kill me. If | have conflict with someone over
anything | worry they are going to kill me or have someone come and kill me. | wake up worried
someone is in my bedroom. | think about trying to be ready to protect myself if someone comes
at me. | don't think | would have this if | had not been traumatised half my life ago.

When | was a child we lived on an all-white road. Nobody was friendly to us and, as luck would
have it, our next door neighbour was a member of the National Front and he kept throwing
abuse over the garden wall at us... It was really horrible, horrible stuff. And when you were
growing up as a child, you think that's how the outside world sees you. You are not going to
have pride in yourself and you actually fear the world around you. | can see where that has had a
knock-on effect on my experience of paranoia.

| thought | was bad because the voices called me all sorts of names. Later | realised that the
voices were related to the physical abuse because they have the characteristics of those that

abused me. Then | noticed that the voices became more or less intrusive depending on the
situation | was in. They became bad when there were conflicts in the house. So they were a kind
of mirror of my living situation.

Having gone through an abusive childhood - physical, verbal, mental and sexual - | have
suffered with severe depression now for over 10 years. Recently, following the breakup of my
marriage, | have started having paranoid thoughts. | constantly feel that | am being followed
when | am driving the car. | have taken alternative routes to evade my followers and on one
occasion really believed my abusive parents were following me. At other times it is the Social
Services. | constantly have these thoughts and at the time cannot justify them, become anxious,
panicky and afraid. Only after can | calm down and quantify them. | also have had paranoid
thoughts about people coming into my garden, re-arranging the plant pots, etc. and my home
where | have thought someone has been in and moved something. When they are happening |
go completely crazy and have even hit myself to make the thoughts go away. Sometimes | feel
that | am losing my mind completely. My doctor has now put me on Olanzapine and they are
somewhat easier to handle but still frighten me and make me feel confused and violated.

6.2 Relationships

As we said earlier, no professional is in a position to say with certainty what has caused a particular
person to experience psychosis at a particular point in their life. This is particularly important in
the area of family relationships. In the past, family members have sometimes felt blamed. Since as
we said above, no-one knows for sure all the reasons that a particular problem might have arisen,
it is very important that professionals do not blame families. However, it is also important to
acknowledge that difficult relationships in childhood and adolescence, which can arise for all kinds
of reasons, may be an important contributing factor for some people. In some cases they might be
highly significant.” Research also confirms that people's friends and families can be very important
in helping their loved ones recover, as we describe in Part 3. People whose home atmosphere is
supportive, calm and tolerant tend to do better.”

Relationships

To improve my health | needed to reduce stress as much as possible. Stay away from
stressful people, which meant | had to be firm with my father about how much | could
see him.

Dolly Sen

We are more likely to experience distress the more our experiences are invalidated and the more
isolated we become from one another. Equally, the further we are from supportive, nurturing

relationships, the more that invalidation and isolation will engender distress. People stripped of
ameliorative influences such as a loving, supportive family and friends; comfortable, safe
environments; and the trust, support and solidarity of others, are increasingly likely to experience
diagnosable distress. In other words, the effects of trauma, social inequality and life events
contingently interact with the less visible, less quantifiable effects of parenting, friendship,
nurturing and caring. This is one reason why ‘the same’ event causes distress in some, but not
others.

Midlands Psychology Group *

6.3 Inequality, poverty, racism and discrimination

We all deal with many stressful events in our lives. The normal and inevitable cycles of childhood,
adolescence, gaining or not gaining qualifications, employment, relationships and the end of
relationships, disease and death affect us all. These major life events are often stressful. In addition,
ongoing stress can affect us - overwork, poor housing, financial difficulties, relationship problems
and so on. And all these pressures are worse if you're poor or a member of a minority which is
subject to prejudice and discrimination.“”

Stress and poverty impact significantly on mental health, leading public health researchers to refer
to the ‘social determinants’ of mental health problems. In the words of a review for the World
Health Organisation: ‘No group is immune to mental disorders, but the risk is higher among the
poor, homeless, the unemployed, persons with low education! Research carried out in the

44 Division of Clinical Psychology


Netherlands found that people who had experienced racism or other forms of discrimination were
more likely to develop unusual or paranoid beliefs (‘delusions’).” Recent research in London”
suggested that two of the three main risk factors for developing distressing psychosis were
deprivation and the experience of living in dense, urban environments. The researchers suggest
that ‘the urban environment can modify brain function in adulthood in response to stress.
nterestingly, the third risk factor was inequality - poor people living in neighbourhoods where
richer people also lived, tended to do worse than those living in neighbourhoods where most
eople had a similar income. This finding is similar to those of researchers Richard Wilkinson and
ate Pickett, whose book The Spirit Level * presented evidence that rates of mental health
roblems are higher in unequal countries - those with larger gaps in income between rich and
oor, such as the UK - than in countries that are more equitable, for example Norway.

People from minority ethnic backgrounds, particularly people of African and African-Caribbean

eritage living in the UK, are much more likely than white British people to be diagnosed with
schizophrenia,” This is true both for people who have moved to the UK from other parts of the
world and for those born in the UK. The reasons for this are complex. Firstly, those of us who have
to live with ongoing and everyday racism are more likely to experience all kinds of mental health
roblems, including psychosis.°*'*? Secondly, many people from BME communities live in cities, and
as mentioned above, rates of psychosis are higher in urban areas.” Thirdly, when we come into
contact with services, those of us from BME backgrounds, and especially young black men, are more
ikely than others to receive a diagnosis of schizophrenia, even if the problems we are experiencing
are much the same.***° We are also more likely to be detained (‘sectioned’), subjected to solitary
confinement (‘seclusion’)***’ medicated against our will, and given higher doses.*** This difference
appears to be the result of misunderstanding, discrimination and stereotyping within services.*°*"?
Most people assume that racism refers to people being personally racist - for example, engaging in
overtly and explicitly racist verbal abuse or actively treating people differently because of their
ethnicity. However, a series of government inquiries have identified that, within institutions like
the police or health service, people from black and minority ethnic backgrounds can end up being
treated differently even if individual members of those institutions do not individually act in this way:
this is known as institutional racism (see section 13.5.1). Fourthly, as a result of this institutional
racism people are also less likely to seek help early, and this can lead to a vicious circle.“

This complex pattern of discrimination and disadvantage is not only dependent on a person's skin
colour: white Irish people can experience similar issues, for example, although usually not to the
same degree. The different forms of prejudice can be cumulative. For instance, if you happen to be
gay, black, working class, a woman and a member of a minority religious group, you may
experience multiple forms of discrimination, from different sources, all with potential
consequences for your mental health.

Section 7: The way we make sense of the world: the
psychology of ‘psychosis’

Key points

Our past experiences affect how we experience and interpret things that happen in the
present. How we make sense of events is crucial in determining how they affect us.

Understanding how people make sense of their experiences is important in helping them find
ways to reduce the distress associated with them.

he way that psychologists understand experiences such as paranoia and hearing voices has
changed radically over the last 20 years, as has our understanding of why they can be so
distressing. We have come to realise the importance not only of life events, but of the ways that
eople make sense of those events and also of experiences such as hearing voices.

7.1 The psychological link between life events and psychosis

he link between life events and psychosis often seems to lie in what psychologists like to call
‘psychological processes’ - the way we experience, interpret and react to the world and other people.

Even where there is no obvious direct link, distressing or traumatic events during a person's
childhood can affect the way that the person experiences and interprets things later in life.’ An
example might be people who grow up in a school environment where they are persistently bullied.
hose people might develop beliefs that they are worthless, that other people are likely to harm
them, and that the world is a callous and unfeeling place. Other experiences that can lead to
sychosis are threat or abuse, particularly from caregivers, or any events that lead to overwhelming

emotions. Naturally, such events affect the way we subsequently experience things and see the
world. Everybody interprets and reacts to new events and challenges in the light of previous
experience. So people who have experienced trauma in the past can sometimes become
overwhelmed or mentally ‘cut off’ when something happens that makes them fearful. People who
have been victimised or subject to racism, hate crime or other forms or prejudice and
discrimination may develop a wary and vigilant - or even paranoid - way of engaging with the
world. Indeed, this may be part of the reason that ‘delusions’ are more common among those of us
who are poor, immigrants or members of marginalised communities.’ Particular life events seem to
be associated with particular psychotic experiences. For example, Professor Richard Bentall and
colleagues have found some evidence that childhood sexual abuse is more likely than other types
of abuse to lead to hearing voices, whereas those brought up in institutional care are slightly more
likely than others to experience paranoia.’

7.2: Hearing voices, inner speech and memories

Most of us at times have difficulty distinguishing what is ‘real’ or external from what is imagined
or internal (‘Did you say something?’ ‘Was that the doorbell?’). This tends to happen more if we are

46 Division of Clinical Psychology


tired, stressed or upset. Most of us also experience an ‘inner voice’ when thinking in words, for
example, when deciding what to do, struggling with a problem, or reading. Evidence that for some
people voice hearing is linked with ‘inner speech’ comes from brain scanning experiments which
show that speech areas in the brain are often active when people hear voices.* Other psychological
experiments show that some people who hear voices can experience difficulty distinguishing
between their thoughts and words spoken to them.’ This blurring of the distinction between inner
and outer speech might be part of the reason that some people hear voices more often than
others. Voices are also often related to memories. For example, someone might hear the voice of
someone who abused or criticised them in the past, and indeed voices can sometimes take on
identities similar to real people in the person's past. Some people relate to their voices more as
people or beings than as sensory experiences.® Sometimes voices express feelings and ideas that are
not clearly memories, but express an aspect of the person's emotional life in some way. Over time,
particularly when they are able to talk about their experiences in therapy and perhaps process
some traumatic memories, people sometimes describe a transition from hearing them outside, to
seeing them as their own thoughts or memories.

Links between life events and voices

What | would ultimately learn was that each voice was closely related to aspects of myself and
that each of them carried overwhelming emotions that I'd never had an opportunity

to process and resolve - memories of sexual trauma and abuse, of shame, anger, loss, and low

self-worth. The voices took the place of this pain and gave words to it. And possibly one of the
greatest revelations was when | realised that the most hostile, aggressive voices actually
represented the parts of me that had been hurt the most profoundly - and as such, it was these
voices that needed to be shown the greatest compassion and care.

7.3 How we develop beliefs and reach conclusions

As human beings we are constantly making sense of our world. Sometimes the conclusions we
come to are frightening, and sometimes we're mistaken. Sometimes we see or hear things that
aren't there. Sometimes our judgements are affected by our past experiences - if we've survived
bullying, abuse or racism, for example, it might be difficult to trust people and we might
understandably become a bit paranoid. Sometimes - for example when we've drunk alcohol or
taken drugs, or sometimes even when we haven't - the way our brain is functioning can affect
our judgement. But in each case, we are actively making sense of our world. Recent research into
‘psychotic’ experiences has found that often this sense-making or interpretation of events
(‘cognitive factors’ in technical language) can play an important role.

Unusual beliefs (‘delusions’) are very similar to other beliefs or prejudices. Many ‘normal’ beliefs
involve a resistance to change and a bias towards evidence that confirms one's initial suspicions.®
An example might be a football supporter who sees one win as confirmation that his or her team
is the best, despite a long run of lost matches. We can probably all think of friends or family
members who hold on to particular beliefs despite - as we see it anyway - all the evidence.

Understanding Psychosis 47


There is a vigorous debate over what might lead to someone developing a particular ‘delusional’
belief, and indeed the process appears to be different for different people. Some people's beliefs
relate closely to things that have happened in their lives. For some they may protect self-
esteem." For some they are related to a particular thinking style, such as a tendency to reach
conclusions quickly.":'*° For others, they may be related to difficulties in social situations," ° or
to being particularly aware of one’s thoughts or of things happening around them.'® Often the
reason will be a combination of these and other things.

7.4 The relationship between emotions and psychosis

As we saw above, experiences such as hearing voices are often linked to our emotions and can
sometimes have their origins in experiences that provoked overwhelming emotion. The way we
make sense of things and reach conclusions is also affected by our emotions.

When we are feeling stressed, anxious, depressed or overwhelmed, the ways that we think about
the world and ourselves change. We become more self-conscious, more self-critical, and more
aware of risks and dangers. If we suspect that people are trying to harm us, or worry that the
voices we hear can do bad things, we are likely to be more easily convinced when we are ina
negative emotional state. And, of course, these links work the other way round as well. If you are
hearing voices threatening to do bad things, you are quite likely to be anxious, suspicious and
perhaps depressed. This close relationship with emotions means that anything that helps with
emotional problems (for example, dealing with sources of stress, or perhaps psychological therapy
focused on anxiety or depression) can also help with psychosis.”’ Similarly, if someone is
experiencing a crisis where their experiences are overwhelming, anything that can help them feel
calmer (kind, reassuring words, for example, or good food, or a peaceful place to stay) will be very
useful in helping to break the vicious circle of experiences and emotions that may be going on.
Often the best way to reduce the likelihood of future psychotic crises is to find ways to reduce
the stress in our lives.

7.5 How psychotic experiences can lead to distress and disability

The above sections have highlighted how the things that happen to us, together with the way we
make sense of them, can affect the likelihood of our having ‘psychotic’ experiences. As we said
above, not everyone finds their experiences distressing - for some people there can even be real
benefits. The question therefore presents itself: why do some people find their experiences
distressing and others less so? Understanding this obviously has the potential to inform how we try
to help people in distress.

7.5.1. How we make sense of our experiences

Although psychologists disagree on some of the details” there is widespread agreement that the
way people make sense of their experiences is key. If people find it difficult to make sense of what
has happened, or are very scared, then they are likely to be more affected. Sometimes people try to
cope with their experiences in ways that are very understandable but can make things worse, for
example by using drugs or alcohol, or by withdrawing from their friends and family. Recent re-
search has confirmed that the way people make sense of and react to their experiences can be very
important in determining how distressing and disabling they go on to be.” (Of course the way we
interpret and react to our experiences is itself influenced by things that have happened to us in the
ast, particularly in our formative years.)

o take an example: if someone is sleep deprived or feeling anxious, and then hears someone
walking behind them in the street, they might fear that the person is following them or planning to
harm them. This thought can in turn make them more anxious, and more likely to notice and worry
about other things, for example other people in the street. If this goes on for a while, they may end
up ina state of high anxiety and begin to worry that something else is going on - for example a

lot to harm them. Depending on what they are personally most afraid of, and their life experiences,
context and culture, they may suspect the involvement of neighbours, the CIA, spirits or perhaps
aliens. They may also hear a voice criticising them or threatening to hurt them. They may then
ecome even more worried or paranoid, and in that state they may interpret ambiguous events even
more readily as a sign that someone is trying to harm them. Their fear may lead them to change the
way they behave, for example stopping going out. This avoidance makes it less likely they will
discover that they are not likely to be hurt. As we explained above, a psychologist might work with
the person to develop a ‘formulation’ of what is going on and therefore what might help. The text
box gives an example of how this worked for one person.

50 Division of Clinical Psychology


How someone arrived at a different understanding of his experiences
which was less distressing and enabled him to move on in his life

This example is taken from a paper by Professor Tony Morrison and colleagues *

A 22-year-old man (let's call him Dan) had received a diagnosis of schizophrenia. Clinicians described
him as having ‘persecutory ideas, thought broadcast (believing that other people can hear your
thoughts), and a delusion that he could read others’ minds: He had initially developed these
experiences and beliefs after a prolonged period of heavy use of drugs and alcohol three years earlier.
He rated the probability of his beliefs being true as 100 per cent.

He had a lump in his neck, which he feared was a device that could broadcast his thoughts to others
and was being used to gather evidence about him. He often checked and prodded the lump, looked
around for danger, and sought reassurance from family and friends. He avoided going out in order to
stay safe and tried to control his thoughts in case they were being transmitted.

Professor Morrison and colleagues point out that if Dan had had slightly different worries about the
lump, he would have been likely to receive a different diagnosis and might not have been seen as
psychotic. For example, had he been worried that it was cancer, and was not reassured by tests, he
might have been diagnosed with health anxiety (formerly called hypochondriasis). Professor Morrison
and colleagues suggest that people come to be seen as psychotic if their beliefs and fears are unusual
or unacceptable within their culture.

Dan also believed that he could deliberately broadcast his thoughts and that this resulted in people
obeying his wishes. He thought he could hear people - usually friends or family members - thinking
bad things about him including ‘I'm going to kill you: These fears were worse when he was stressed
and led to him feeling angry, anxious, depressed and experiencing physical changes including flushes
and palpitations. For this reason he tried to suppress these thoughts.

In collaboration with his clinical psychologist, Dan worked out what he thought was going on. He
discovered that he was stuck in several vicious circles that were keeping the problem going.
Experiences earlier in his life had led him to see the world in a particular way. For example, being
bullied had led him to feel bad about himself and also to find it difficult to trust others. This affected
the way he interpreted ambiguous situations. For example, when he found the lump he was quicker
than others might have been to reach the conclusion that it was caused by others trying to harm
him. The way he reacted to these beliefs - for example isolating himself and avoiding others -
prevented him finding out that they weren't true.

Together, Dan and his clinical psychologist developed a ‘formulation’ which they wrote down in the
form of a diagram. It showed how his experiences had led him to interpret events and behave in
certain ways, and used arrows to represent the vicious circles that appeared to be keeping him stuck.

It looked like this (next page):

Understanding Psychosis 51


How Dan came to understand his problems

A formulation identifying vicious circles
(the arrows represent what leads to what):

Events: What happens

—
<>

Thoughts: How | interpret the events

Beliefs: About myself, my thoughts,
others and the world

Life experiences

/ \

Responses: What | do when this happens «> Feelings: How | feel

52 Division of Clinical Psychology



Dan and his psychologist then drew on this formulation to work out what might help. The
psychologist explained that intrusive thoughts are quite common. Dan began to try to notice the
thoughts as they occurred and, with help from his psychologist, worked out ways he could test
them out. For example, he worked out that his belief that he could get people to do things by
broadcasting his thoughts was largely based on people doing things that they were likely to do
anyway, such as waving goodbye or changing gear. With the support of his psychologist he
decided to experiment with trying to get people to do things which were less likely. He found
that, as predicted, they rarely did these things. Together with the psychologist, Dan examined
the evidence for and against his belief that he could read thoughts from other people's minds.
He did this by observing closely how people behaved, and reached the conclusion that perhaps
his idea that they were thinking bad things about him was in part a reflection of his own
feelings of inadequacy and weakness. He was able to explore and question his negative beliefs
about himself, and eventually came to feel better about himself. He also came to realise that
trying to suppress his thoughts was paradoxically making them more intrusive. One thing that
helped him work this out was when the psychologist suggested a ‘thought experiment’: trying
NOT to think of a giraffe. Of course even though he rarely thought about giraffes, at that
moment it was hard not to. He set himself goals and activities to ensure that he was able to go
out more and re-engage with his friends. Finally he reached the point where he felt much better
and was able to return to college.

spring from disease of thought -- from moods of mind... They who dream by day are cognisant

of many things which escape those who dream only by night.

From ‘Eleonora’ by Edgar Allan Poe (1850)

Many people who have experienced psychosis feel that it has positive as well as negative aspects.”*
7728.9 For example, there can be a link with creativity” and the possible nature of this link has
recently been explored in brain imaging studies.*' ‘Psychosis’ sometimes appears to involve making
idiosyncratic connections between events that others would see as unrelated. This is not in itself
either good or bad. Sometimes making unusual connections between things is valuable and in that
case it might be seen as originality, lateral thinking or creativity. In fact, people who score highly
on measures of ‘schizotypy’ (or ‘psychosis-proneness’) also score highly on measures of creativity.”
Some people who are famous for their creativity also appear to have had what might be called
psychotic experiences. Examples might include Vincent Van Gogh, Stephen Fry, Joan of Arc,
Winston Churchill and Ghandi. Self- help organisation The Icarus Project views both ‘psychotic’ and
‘bipolar’ experiences as ‘a dangerous gift’ and aims to help its members ‘navigate the space
between brilliance and madness.”

There is also increasing interest in the idea that mental health crises, although painful, can
sometimes lead to positive changes over the longer term - so called ‘post-traumatic growth: Some
people view them as spiritual crises, *** with the potential to lead to spiritual growth. This is
discussed in the next section. Some people also feel that their experiences have had a role in
processing and healing past trauma.” ”

Positive aspects of ‘psychotic’ and ‘bipolar’ experiences

My manic depression is responsible for a great deal of the positive energy and creativity in my
life. For a great deal of the time | am blessed with buckets of energy - more than most people. |
love to work hard. My thoughts work like liquid crystal. | can see what things mean quickly and
clearly. Ideas - generally good ideas - come to me with little or no effort. | know my surfeit of
energy can be irritating to others, but my brain does all the things | want it to very efficiently
and | am proud of it. | feel extremely engaged with, and part of, life.

Dr Rachel Perkins OBE “°

|... was sent for EEG tests, was told that | was hallucinating ... | just felt that this really positive
experience was just scrutinised and ... mocked. | didn't feel offended, | just thought they were
being really stupid, and disregarding this ... really important thing...

Once, within my own space,

A lighted space, warm amid the darkness,

| thought that | was Eve, the Virgin Mary,
Joan of Arc and many, many more

Of our foremothers

And | was one with all the women of history.

This was and is for me a high point,

7.5.3. Spirituality

As people who have lived through extremes of mental and emotional distress, we are tired of

being categorised and feared, worn down by being voices in the wilderness - voices that cry out
for a humane and holistic understanding of who we are, that embraces physical and spiritual as
well as psychological and emotional wellbeing.

Vicky Nicholls *

There is growing interest in the idea of that ‘psychotic’ crises can sometimes be part of, or related
to spiritual crises, and many people feel that their crises have contributed to spiritual growth. A
number of clinical psychologists have also explored the interface between psychosis and
spirituality. *°*” Some believe that at least some ‘psychotic’ episodes can be transformative crises
that contain the potential for personal, including spiritual, growth.* Many people who believe that
there is a spiritual element to their experiences find support from others with similar beliefs
invaluable, for example within faith communities.”

People who see ‘psychotic’ crises as spiritual crises
For me, becoming ‘mentally ill’ was always a spiritual crisis, and finding a spiritual model of
recovery was a question of life and death. My search began over 30 years ago, when | took time
off from college studies to shut myself in my room alone to find God and the meaning of life.
For a week or so, | listened to music, entertained myself with mental images, and had spiritual
revelations. | experienced many unusual perceptions and bodily changes similar to ones that
occur with drugs such as LSD. All of this climaxed with a vision of the oneness and
interdependence of everything in the universe - the sort of thing that sounds foolish when put
into words, but is profoundly true for those who experience it... The questions remain...
If altered states have value, what is there to recover from?

Sally Clay °

| think the spiritual aspects... are never taken into account in terms of western psychiatry. | don't
think they have got there yet. They understand that spirituality is important in terms of recovery
but they don't take it into account in terms of diagnosis... Some of us have got too close or our
ancestors are very close to us...we are being traumatized by this experience. Now you see, | talk
about the slave trade and tears come. Do you understand me? So now | have this open channel...

all the time | could hear people knocking and screaming, it was like | was haunted... When we
went to Ghana and we went to the Castle...when | stood at the door | could feel my ancestor
when she was at that door...You know this spirituality aspect... in terms of diagnosis that has
never been addressed. | never disclosed it because...they just don't know how to deal with it.

Understanding Psychosis 55


People who see ‘psychotic’ crises as spiritual crises (continued)
| suppose | have a predisposition towards belief and frequently go into churches or other
religious places to ‘pray’ (meditate/relax). | believe there are powers that we cannot see and fully
understand - perhaps love, perhaps electromagnetism. Like many people, | am not indifferent to
questions about the meaning of life.

At the same time, the course of my own life has been shaped and, to some extent, diverted from
its expected direction by a number of occasions when | have gone through profound, vivid and
disturbing interior experiences which might be considered to be spiritual crises.

At these times - times of elation, exhaustion, anxiety, fear - | have lost firm contact with the
reality accepted by those around me, have entered a space where other realities and other
jowers are more urgent and have experienced the consequences.

Once, down Hammersmith Broadway, considering myself Christ-like, | laid out all my possessions
yy the west door of a church in a diagrammatic Calvary and was picked up for crying out in the
street. Another time, more recently, | believed myself the cause and focus of an impending
collision between the earth and the setting sun and was found mute and unmoving in the shade
of a garden hedge on Dollis Hill, North West London.

nevitably, my beliefs and actions at times like these led to a confirmed diagnosis of ‘psychotic
mental illness’ and all that follows from it. On more than one occasion, when | have been
struggling to hold onto my humanity, uncertain whether | was good or evil, Christ-like or Satan,
have found myself locked up and abandoned in a cell, deprived of human contact, observed but
not comforted.

What concerns me most are the spiritual difficulties facing individuals who enter the mental
ealth service system. How do they value their experiences in crises? How do they withstand the
scrutiny of science? How do they locate themselves within a society that sees them as damaged
uman beings?

here are a number of possible responses to ‘psychotic episodes: One is to view them as
aberrations without intrinsic value. This seems to be a common approach in psychiatry and is the
one | have almost always encountered there. Although it is important to define the causes of
crises, the contents are not important. They are not worth understanding or are not capable of
eing understood - ‘like the workings of a steam engine whose pistons have fallen off’, as a
sychiatrist once put it to me. As a result the main action that is necessary is to intervene, often
in medical ways, to control the episodes and prevent them happening again.

While | do not deny the value of practical crisis prevention, | feel such an approach is destructive.
t not only suggests to me that the contents of my crisis are dangerous and impenetrable, but
also presses me to separate myself from them. This | cannot easily do.

Nor, | suspect, can many who experience similar crises. They remain part of us. We want to
incorporate our insights into our lives, not to bind them in protective wrapping and carry them
around with us as hidden baggage.

Part 3: What can help

Understanding Psychosis


Introduction to Part 3

Part 2 showed how each person's difficulties are likely to have arisen, and be maintained by a

unique combination of interacting factors. Whilst not everyone finds their experiences distressing,

Part 3 describes the forms of help that are, or should be available for those who do. First of all
eople need the opportunity to work out what is going on - what might be causing the problem

a

and keeping it going. We also need support from our friends, families and communities, and this is
the first type of help we describe here, together with self-help. We then go on to describe how
rofessionals can help (sometimes called ‘treatment’). In this section we describe the vital practical
and emotional support that mental health workers can provide, which needs to focus on helping

eople achieve their personal goals. Next we cover psychological or talking-based therapies.
Psychologists have been very active over recent years in developing and evaluating these
approaches, which have the potential to revolutionise the way that services approach psychosis.
Finally, we consider the pros and cons of medication, and the different ways people use it.

Section 8: Arriving at a shared understanding
of the problem

Key points

Psychologists work by collaborating with people to develop a ‘formulation’: a shared
understanding and description of the person's main problems and what might help.

Formulations include possible causes, potential triggers, ideas about what might be keeping the
problems going, and a summary of the strengths and resources that the person can draw on.

Formulations are useful in suggesting what might help.

Before deciding what might help, someone who is experiencing distressing voices or paranoid
thoughts will want to work out how they understand them: why they might have started, what is
keeping them going, and what makes them so distressing.

8.1 Formulation

A formulation is a way of making sense of, or understanding what is going on. Formulations often
take the form of written summaries or diagrams, developed by a process of collaboration between
the professional and the service user. A formulation:

1. Summarises the person's main problems.

2. Suggests how the difficulties may relate to one another. For example there may be vicious
circles going on as we saw with Dan's story in section 7.5. Psychological ‘models’ (theories) of
the processes that may be involved will be useful to draw on here.

58 Division of Clinical Psychology


3. Suggests what might have led the person to experience the difficulties, and why here and
now.

4. Suggests what might help, including how the person might be able to draw on their own
particular strengths.

5. Is always a tentative ‘best guess’, and open to revision and re-formulation.
ls developed collaboratively and agreed by both parties (the clinician and the service user).

7. | Where a multi-disciplinary team is involved, the formulation informs the person's overall care
plan.'

Formulations explore the personal meaning of the events, relationships and social circumstances of
someone's life, and of their current experiences or distress. Unlike a diagnosis, formulation is based
on the assumption that, however extreme, unusual or overwhelming the nature of that distress,
“at some level it all makes sense’? The person experiencing the difficulty works together with the
rofessional to develop a hypothesis, or best guess, about why voices (for example) might have
appeared, in the context of the person's life experiences and the sense they have made of them.
his can suggest the best way forward.’

nsome settings the term ‘formulation’ is used for a description that accompanies a ‘diagnosis’,
giving some additional details about the person. However, in the sense used here, formulations are
generally alternatives to diagnosis. Recent professional guidelines suggest that this is how clinical
sychologists should use them (in their clinical practice at least, although we may still need some
way of categorising problems for the purposes of service planning).‘ Briefly, clinical psychologists
argue that if we can provide, through psychological theory and evidence, a reasonably complete
account of why someone may hear voices, hold unusual beliefs or experience paranoia, there is no
need for an extra explanation such as ‘they have schizophrenia as well: Indeed, this would not
really be an explanation anyway, since diagnosis in mental health is really a process of categorising
rather than explaining experiences, and as we outlined above, its usefulness has been challenged
even in that regard. In the words of clinical psychologist Professor Richard Bentall, ‘Once these
complaints (the experiences or problems that someone describes) have been explained, there is no
ghostly disease remaining that also requires an explanation. Complaints are all there is!’ Some
psychologists believe that many of what we have traditionally called ‘complaints’ or ‘symptoms’ are
survival strategies which were essential at the time but which have outgrown their usefulness.° A
formulation can help to make sense of them.

Eleanor's story

A turning point for me came when | was referred to a new psychiatrist, Pat Bracken. The very
first time | met him he said to me, ‘Hi Eleanor, nice to meet you. Can you tell me a bit about
yourself?’ So | just looked at him and said ‘I'm Eleanor and I'm a schizophrenic? And in his quiet,

Irish voice he said something very powerful, 'l don't want to know what other people have told
you about yourself, | want to know about you It was the first time that | had been given the
chance to see myself as a person with a life story, not as a genetically-determined schizophrenic
with aberrant brain chemicals and biological flaws and deficiencies that were beyond my power
to heal. Previously I'd been told by a psychiatrist that | would have been better off with cancer as
it would have been easier to cure. Pat Bracken was so much more humane than that. And he
didn't talk about auditory hallucinations; he talked about hearing voices, and unusual beliefs
rather than delusions, anxiety rather than paranoia. He didn't use this terrible mechanistic,
clinical language; he just couched it in normal language and normal experience... I've always had

a dominant voice and that has been constant throughout my experience. He has named himself
and given himself an identity. He has a physical form, Machiavellian and rather grotesque. He is
the archetypal horror film figure...

began to slowly realise that yes, he is a demon, but he was a personal demon. Everyone has their
rivate demons and his demonic aspects were the unaccepted aspects of my self-image, my
shadow, so it was appropriate that he was so shadowy. He'd always been dismissed as this
sychotic hallucination, but even his physical form did have meaning to it. The only way |
recovered was by learning that this grotesque aspect of him is superfluous. The contempt and
oathing that he expresses is actually to do with me in that it reflects how | feel about myself. He
is like a very external form of my own insecurities, my own self-doubt and that is the part that is
relevant and does need attending to, does need taking seriously because he is meaningful. What
e says is a very powerful statement about what | am feeling about myself, and in that respect |
do relate him to me by learning to deconstruct this figure and learn what is relevant and what
isn't. He has a lot of relevance and a lot of personal meaning and he is capable of making very
owerful statements about issues in my life that | need to deal with. This included childhood
abuse, as well as adulthood experiences of injustice and adversity. It is difficult because voices are

often metaphorical and you need to find the literal meaning in a figurative form of speech and
seek the personal relevance in it. For instance, when he talks very violently about mutilation and
death | see it as a barometer and realise that | need to take better care of myself and attend to my
own needs more. It sounds like a bizarre thing to say, but he is useful in that he does provide
insight into conflicts that | need to deal with.

It took a long time, but it got to the point where my demons could be cast out. While he is still

around - he has never left and he is still there - he has lost his power to devastate me. | listen to
him now because | understand that I'm actually listening to me. | don't catastrophise him. | see
that like when my mum gets very stressed, she gets bad headaches; when | get very stressed, |
hear really bad voices. | now show respect to him and he is now more likely to show me respect.
Essentially, this represents taking a more compassionate, empathic and forgiving stance towards
myself.

In developing a formulation, the following questions might be useful for the professional and the
person concerned to consider together:

1. What are the problems? A shared understanding of the problems is vital and should be
expressed in the person's own everyday language, e.g. ‘I get very upset because people stare
at me and | worry that they are thinking bad things about me: Different people may
understand their problems in very different ways depending on their background, culture or
subculture,’ beliefs and previous life experiences. It is important for professionals to bear
these things in mind, to ask about them (see for example the ‘cultural formulation
interview'” developed by Dr Sushrut Jadhav), and to respect the person's framework of
understanding. What does the person find most distressing? How do the problems interfere
with their life or stop them doing things they would like to do?

2. What might have led to the problems starting? For example, early experiences of neglect or
criticism can lead us to hold deep seated views of ourselves that are very negative,
e.g. ‘lam worthless’, ‘l am a failure. What was the personal meaning of the events and/or
circumstances, and what was their impact on the person? For example, abuse may have left
someone feeling ashamed or guilty; domestic violence might have convinced someone that
they were worthless and trapped; poverty might have led someone to feel excluded and
devalued. Some people - perhaps particularly those who see their problems in terms of an
illness - might wonder about the role of some kind of genetic predisposition. All these ideas
are likely to develop in the course of the conversation as the two people try to make sense of
the experiences.

3. What triggers the problems, what sets them off? For example ‘Whenever | feel sad, the
voices start. This tends to be when I'm on my own:

4. What keeps the problem going? This might be thoughts (e.g. ‘people are right to judge me’)
things we do (e.g. ‘I try to avoid going out’; ‘When | go out | keep my head down and try not
to look at people’) and/or getting stuck in difficult patterns of interactions with others.

5. What strengths and resources does the person have? What personal and social resources
have protected the person and prevented the problems from escalating? Examples might
include the courage to continue going out despite anxieties, or supportive relationships with
friends who are not judgemental. How can these strengths be built upon and reinforced?

The text box gives an example of what the resulting formulation might look like.

Understanding Psychosis 61


An example of a formulation

Jane is 20 and has started to hear critical and hostile voices. If she has been given a diagnosis,
it would most likely be psychosis or schizophrenia. Alternatively, a written formulation
developed with Jane over a few weeks or months might look something like this:

You had a happy childhood until your father died when you were aged eight. As a child, you
felt very responsible for your mother's happiness, and pushed your own grief away. Later your
mother remarried and when your stepfather started to abuse you, you did not feel able to
confide in anyone or risk the break-up of the marriage. You left home as soon as you could,
and got a job in a shop. However, you found it increasingly hard to deal with your boss, whose
bullying ways reminded you of your stepfather. You gave up the job, but long days at home in

your flat made it hard to push your buried fee

ings aside any more. One day you started to

hear a male voice telling you that you were dirty and evil. This seemed to express how the

abuse made you feel, and it also reminded you
found day-to-day life increasingly difficult as
feelings came to the surface. Despite this you

of things that your stepfather said to you. You
ast events caught up with you and many
ave many strengths, including intelligence,

determination and self-awareness, and you recognise the need to re-visit some of the

unprocessed feelings from the past. You have

n this example the emphasis is on how the prob!

riends who will support you in this.

ems started and developed over time (what

sychologists call a ‘developmental formulation’). The example given in section 7.5 above (Dan's
story) included more detail about what was keeping the problem going in the present - what
sychologists call a ‘maintenance formulation’:

8.2 Deciding what is likely to help

he next section describes the different forms of help that are available. For most of us, what is
most important is the practical and emotional help that we receive from our friends, families and
communities. We therefore deal with this first. We then describe the various forms of professional
help that are available. These include the talking-based approaches (psychological therapies) which
the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends should be available to
everyone who experiences distressing psychosis. It is important to remember that not everyone
inds it helpful to focus directly - at least in the first instance - on their experiences or unusual
eliefs. They may want to focus on other aspects of their life - for example, improving their mood,

or finding work - or to work on developing existing strengths. Once someone is aware of what is
available, they themselves are in the best position to decide what is likely to help and it is
important that they are able to exercise this choice wherever possible rather than the professionals
making the decisions. They may also need to try things out to see what is most helpful.

Types of help can be divided into four broad categories, and the next sections take each of these in
turn.

. Self-help, and help from friends, family and our communities (Section 9)

. Practical and emotional help from professionals (Section 10)
Talking based approaches/psychological help (Section 11)

Medication (Section 12).

Section 9: Self-help and help from family, friends and
communities

Key points

Although professional support can be helpful, often the most important source of help and
support is our network of relationships: friends, family and community.

A useful role for professionals is helping friends, family and self-help groups to support people.

There is an active ‘service user and survivor’ movement, which offers a community of support
and a forum for campaigning.

Introduction

he community - our own existing network of relationships, and new ones that we develop - is the
most important source of help for many people, although it is often overlooked in favour of a

ocus on ‘treatments’ delivered by professionals. Whatever the nature of someone's difficulties, the
most important things are those we all need - supportive relationships, good housing, freedom
rom constant money or other worries, enjoyable and meaningful things to do, and a valued role
within our community. Often it helps to concentrate less on our difficulties, and more on our
strengths and potential.

he Mental Health Foundation’s Strategies for Living project asked people with mental health
roblems what helps them most.’ The findings were both ordinary and ground-breaking in that
they showed clearly that it is generally not ‘treatment’ that helps people most, but more everyday
things. Relationships with professionals and therapists were helpful, but more important were

those with friends, family and other service users - people that we spend much more time with.
Medication could be helpful but so were other strategies such as finding ways of obtaining peace
of mind or thinking positively, religious and spiritual beliefs and lifestyles that promote health and
wellbeing. What appeared to underlie the strategies that people chose or discovered was the need
for:

e Acceptance

e Shared experience and shared identity
e Emotional support...’being there’

e Reason for living

e Finding meaning and purpose

° Peace of mind and relaxation

e Taking control and having choices

e Security and safety

° Pleasure.

Understanding Psychosis 63


9.1 Support from friends and family

Support from friends and family is often the most important form of help. The organisation Re-
think Mental Illness* asked people who had used mental health services how friends and family
members can best help. The most important ways appeared to be:

e Acceptance - showing love and support, valuing the person's views and opinions.

e Education - learning about what the person is experiencing and how you might be able to
elp.

e Mediation - offering to accompany your friend or relative to appointments, to mediate
etween them and mental health staff, or to act as an advocate on their behalf if needed.

e Helping the person to regain their independence after a crisis - encouraging them to go out,
to join a support or self-help group, and to do things independently. Being patient - people
need to move at their own pace.

e Finding a balance between independence and dependency. Both extremes can be harmful;
independence can lead to isolation, while dependency can lead to people getting stuck in a
‘sick role’

e Remembering the fun things in life - going out and doing ordinary things together can make

all the difference to a person's recovery.

e Family members need to take care of their own needs - if you are experiencing stress, it is
difficult to help someone else.

9.1.1 How services can help friends and family to support people

Although relationships can sometimes be difficult and stressful, friends and family are also most
people's main source of help and support, even for people who live alone. Sometimes they are
referred to as ‘carers’, although there is a debate about how helpful the term is in this context.’

Friends and relatives are often not sure how best to help. Sometimes trying to help is frustrating
and difficult, for example when a loved one is withdrawn, ‘lost’ in their experiences, or acts in an
embarrassing or disruptive way. Often the stressful events that have led to someone experiencing a
crisis are ones that also affect the whole family, so everyone is dealing with increased stress.
Sometimes, even though they are trying to help, friends and family can become critical or actively
hostile towards the person, or perhaps respond by trying to look after them rather as if they were a
child again. While this reaction (which some researchers refer to as ‘emotionally over-involved’) is
understandable and can sometimes be helpful in the short term, over the longer term it can be
unhelpful and exhausting for everyone. Either or both of these attitudes (i.e. criticism and/or over-
involvement) have been described as ‘high expressed emotion’ and if extreme can lead to poorer
outcomes.‘ Conversely, where friends and relatives are able to maintain a calm and relaxed
atmosphere at home, it can make all the difference to the person's recovery.

How family and friends can help

| couldn't have got through the experience (a psychotic episode and time in hospital) without
family and friends. My brother, who was unwell himself, took me home to my parents when he
saw | was getting ill. We shared a very surreal tube journey home during which | told him the
people at work were witches and that | needed to be exorcised. He generously nodded and said,
‘OK, Jen: My parents took me to the local GP and then to hospital. They were there when | raced,
terrified, around the hospital ward, and also when | came round some three days later and said
to my mum, ‘I think I've been acting a bit strangely: She sat by my bed and hugged me. My
boyfriend sat with me holding my hand while my head was spinning with ridiculous notions and
ideas. After I'd come round my brother brought craft materials with him to make a card for his
girlfriend. We didn't talk about where we were or what had happened, we talked about cutting
up photos to make the card. | helped him a bit with the photos of sky. Well, maybe ‘helped’ is too
generous a word! Hospital was a strange, unknown place. Having visitors helped me to keep my
spirits up and believe | was going to go home soon. It must have been hard for them to come to
a strange concrete building and make a visit they didn't think they'd have to make. For me it
meant the world. It meant normal life flowing into a place that was not normal at all. It meant
relationships and connections that helped me build resilience. | found, when | was experiencing a
psychotic episode, that | sensed connections between all things, permeating us all. Afterwards, it
was the connections between my loved ones that meant so much. | will forever be grateful to all
my loved ones who showed me such warmth, generosity and friendship through that time, and
have continued to through the times to come. If a loved one of yours has had to go into
hospital, please do go and visit them. Your being there will make all the difference. Don't be
scared of what to say. Say anything. Say nothing. Ask them how they are. Talk about a film
you've seen recently, or your cats, or the fact that your boiler's on the blink. It doesn't matter,
just sharing your solidarity at a difficult time: it breathes life into any situation, no matter how
hard it seems.

The family therapy has been an extremely important bond between the services of care and the
family. We have grown as a family to understand the difficulties and challenges of caring for my
brother who has severe psychosis. We have learned the meaning of the psychosis - it has been
extremely educational... The most important part of the family therapy has been the reflection
and listening without judgement... That is the wonderful thing about the family therapy - it

embraces the difference without judgement.

Sometimes it can be helpful for groups other than families to have such meetings. For example,
someone might want to have similar conversations with friends, flatmates or close work colleagues.
For the small number of people who are very disabled by their experiences and live in supported
accommodation, it can be helpful to have similar meetings with the staff who provide the support,
perhaps facilitated by someone from the local mental health team.

In some mental health services, family meetings are based on the traditional idea that the
‘identified patient’ has an illness which other family members need to understand and make
allowances for. However, in others the starting point for meetings is that different people are likely
to have different beliefs about the nature and causes of the problem and what might help. The aim
of meetings is to arrive at an understanding of the problem that is acceptable to all involved, and
to use that understanding to plan a possible way forward.'° The most non-directive of such
approaches, ‘Open Dialogue’,"* originates from Finland” but is becoming increasingly popular in the
UK. Where services use this approach, as soon as someone is referred workers ask for their
permission to arrange regular meetings. Meetings could include mental health staff, the person
themselves and all those around them including family members, employer, neighbours and friends.
The meetings offer a chance for all those involved to listen to each other and take seriously each

other's understanding of what is going on. All decisions are made at these meetings. It is reported
that within such services, fewer than a third of people are prescribed neuroleptic medication.
Although randomised controlled trials (sometimes called the ‘Gold Standard’ for research) have not
yet been undertaken, recovery rates appear to be high, both in terms of reduced ‘symptoms’ and
use of services, and in terms of ‘social’ recovery, for example being able to return to work."

There are also many ways that people who are experiencing paranoia or distressing voices can help
themselves and each other. Feeling isolated can be a major source of stress to people who are
struggling with distressing experiences. Meeting other people with similar experiences in self-help
groups and other settings can be key to feeling less alone, and people are able to learn from each
other about what can help. There are groups for people who share particular experiences, for
example hearing voices or self-harm. Black users of mental health services have often formed self-
help groups because services were not culturally appropriate - or sufficiently available - and
because, given the existence of racism in society and in institutions like mental health services,
they felt there was a need to create a safe space for people from BME backgrounds.” There are
also women-only and LGBT-only groups, for example. Collective approaches like this can also be
helpful in building a sense of solidarity between members.

Being accepted in my full humanity, with my differences, has also been vital and something
| have been more likely to find among fellow survivors than within services.

Peter Campbell ”

Some self-help groups run independently and others are facilitated or co-facilitated by mental
health workers. Often workers act in a facilitative role, offering support in the background, with
the aim of withdrawing once group members are able to run the group.”

Sometimes individuals make their own self-help materials available for the benefit of others,
sharing their experience and helpful strategies they have used. Examples can be found in the
‘resources’ section at the end of this report.

9.2.1 The Hearing Voices Network

The Hearing Voices Network (HVN)* is a network of self-help groups for ‘people who hear voices, see
visions or have unusual perceptions: It originated from the work of Dutch psychiatrist, Marius
Romme, and his colleague Sandra Escher. The HVN is explicitly based on the idea that different people
have different ideas about the nature and causes of their experiences. There are over 180 groups
across the UK which meet regularly and give people the opportunity to talk freely and to support one
another. HVN is also active internationally.®

medical illness ... | didn't believe | was a psychiatric patient with a lifelong brain disease any
more, but an overcomer of childhood sexual abuse, an activist for change in the current system
that is based on an outdated medical model.

9.2.2 Complementary approaches

There have been few formal trials of complementary therapies such as massage, yoga and exercise.
However, many people find that they help to reduce the high levels of stress and arousal which
often play a role in mental health crises.

To improve my health | needed to learn and practice relaxation techniques. Only a few months
of yoga and meditation and everyone, | mean everyone, noticed the difference.

9.2.3 Peer Support
Peer support is a term used to describe mutual support between people who use mental health
services.”

There are three types of peer support:”

e Informal, naturally occurring peer support (for example, between two people who are both
inpatients on the same ward)

e Participation in service user run (peer-run) groups or programmes

e Service users as paid providers of services - formal peer support.

Understanding Psychosis 69


There is considerable evidence that the first type of support is common” and very valuable in hospitals
and other mental health services.” The second type (self-help groups) was described above. The third
type, i.e. the employment of service users as peer support workers in mainstream mental health
services, is becoming increasingly common within UK mental health services and NICE recommends
that services consider it.” Peer support workers help people by sharing their experience, providing an
empathic and reciprocal relationship, and giving encouragement and hope. Research suggests that
the person receiving support, the person giving it and wider services can all benefit. 45°

Peer support
We recommend that organisations should consider a radical transformation of the workforce,
aiming for perhaps 50 per cent of care delivery by appropriately trained and supported ‘peer
professionals:

9.2.4 Community development approaches

Community development involves members of communities working together to develop collective
solutions to common problems.”****' Community Development Workers - people skilled in facilitating
collective approaches - are often key. This is a relatively recent development in mental health,” but
a good example is the Sharing Voices * project in Bradford which brings together people from
different faiths, cultures and backgrounds. The project website (www.sharingvoices.net) states that
‘mental health experiences often arise from issues around: poverty, racism, unemployment, loneliness,
family conflicts, relationship difficulties and cannot be merely understood through biological terms
alone. So listening to people's own explanation and helping them find their solutions to problems is
a key part of our work: The project has a strong commitment to mutual aid and a number of self-
help/mutual aid groups have been set up by people with first-hand experience of distress.

9.2.5 Recovery colleges: an educational approach to offering help

Recovery colleges are a new development. In contrast to the traditional approach where clinicians offer
treatments, recovery colleges offer an educational approach. The aim is to help people improve their
wellbeing, take control of their recovery and achieve their hopes and aspirations. Courses are designed
and delivered by professionals working in partnership with people whose expertise is derived from lived
experience. They are open to people who use services, their relatives and friends, and also to staff.****

9.2.6 The service user/survivor movement

Increasingly, people are describing and reflecting on their experiences as part of a growing
literature written from what could be broadly called a service user and survivor perspective.”
Within this body of work, some major themes appear to be:

e Different views about the nature and meaning of experiences

e Seeing benefits as well as challenges in ‘psychotic’ experiences
e Links between ‘madness’, creativity and spirituality

e Feeling dehumanised by some aspects of mental health services.

Independent service user and survivor groups have flourished in recent times and are often at the
forefront of introducing innovative approaches, either providing services independently or
contributing to mainstream mental health services. 2007 saw the establishment of the National
Survivor User Network (NSUN),” an independent service user-led charity that connects people with
experience of mental health issues to give them a stronger voice in shaping policy and services.

Section 10: Practical and emotional help from
professionals

Key points

Skilled professional help can make a big difference, but workers need to be open to different
ways of understanding experiences.

Getting help early can make a big difference.

Emotional support and help with practical issues such as work and employment, benefits,
housing and relationships is often as important as help targeted directly at ‘symptoms:

We urgently need more crisis facilities, particularly ones based on the psychological approach
outlined in this report rather than on one that sees crises primarily as relapses of an illness.

If services adopted the approach described here, there would be less need for compulsion
under mental health legislation. The British Psychological Society has argued that the decision
to detain someone should be based on their ability to make the relevant decisions (‘capacity’)
rather than on whether they have a psychiatric diagnosis.

Introduction: what are services for?

This section is about the practical and emotional help and support which is often the most
important thing that services provide. Traditionally, mental health services have focused on
reducing ‘symptoms’ such as voices or paranoid thoughts. However, as we explained above, not
everyone finds their experiences distressing, and not everyone understands them as symptoms.

It is vital that mental health workers are open to different ways of understanding experiences,
and do not insist that people see their difficulties in terms of an illness. This simple change will
have a profound and transformative effect on our mental health services.

In recent years the focus has moved to reducing distress and helping people to live the kind of life
that they want, whether or not the experiences continue. This has sometimes been termed a
‘recovery’ approach. This approach has been the subject of some controversy because some people
feel that the term recovery unhelpfully implies that there is an ‘illness’ to recover from. There have
also been instances where it has been used as an excuse for withdrawing support from people with
ongoing needs. The idea of ‘wellbeing’ has been suggested as an alternative.’ However, the
‘recovery’ approach has driven positive change within many mental health services.’* The emphasis
is on each person finding their own way to a life that is meaningful and satisfying for them,
drawing on personal strengths and on support from people within and outside the mental health
system.* This last point is important: ‘recovery’ does not mean that people should be able to do
without help.* Many people experience ongoing, disabling problems and it is vital that the idea is
not used as an excuse to cut services or withdraw support.*’ Services need to support people in
whatever way they personally find most helpful. Sometimes this is referred to as ‘services on tap,
not on top‘?

72 Division of Clinical Psychology


Adopting a recovery or wellbeing approach represents a major change in the culture and
organisation of services, since different people may have very different goals. In the UK, the Centre
for Mental Health has led the way in championing such an approach’ ” and the Implementing
Recovery - Organisational Change (ImROC) programme" has supported mental health trusts to
change their structures and practice.

Tools are available to help people take control of their own recovery and wellbeing, such as WRAP
(Wellness Recovery Action Plan).'? Such tools provide a framework to help people to identify their
strengths and sources of support, to plan their time in a way that helps them to stay well, to think
about what the warning signs might be of a mental health crisis and how to keep safe, and to
write an ‘advance directive’ about what they want to happen if they are admitted to hospital.

10.1 Making sure basic needs are met

People who are coping with overwhelming experiences may need help with looking after their
basic needs such as housing, money and good food." Help with practical issues is often as, or even
more important than traditional ‘treatments’ such as therapy or medication. Services need to be
flexible enough to offer each individual what he or she finds most helpful at that particular point.
Clinical psychologist Professor Daniel Freeman has highlighted the important role that lack of
sleep, or poor sleep can play in mental health crises, and has suggested ways that services can help
people to sleep better." ® Crises can often come about as a result of a vicious circle: experiences
become overwhelming partly because the person needs water, food and sleep, but in their
distressed, confused or over-excited state they are not able to deal with these needs themselves.
Crisis services such as wards need to attend to these needs first.

Interestingly it's often the basics which are missed in mental health patients. | worked out with a
friend once that he had ended up sectioned many times on account of being incoherent because
of lack of food and fluids, but this hadn't been checked. | saw it with own eyes, him looking

‘sectionable’, feeding/hydrating him and watching him return to sentences.

10.2 Emotional support

It is hard to overemphasise the importance of care, kindness, listening and emotional support in
times of distress, and this is often the most important thing that workers can offer. Research on
psychiatric wards'® found that what people valued most was ‘human contact with staff: The
researchers concluded that ‘even the briefest of human communication had a disproportionately
powerful and positive effect if it was based on an empathetic approach’

How services and workers helped

was an active participant in my own recovery, just as | had been active in my self- destruction.
But it was my social worker Bernadette who enabled me to engage in the process, who made my
recovery possible.

How did she do it? From the first, Bernadette managed to convey that she wanted to work with
me. This is not a desire that can be faked; she conveyed it because she felt it. | remember
umping into her in the street very shortly after we started working together. 'How nice to see
you, she said, and it was clear to me that she meant it. The mere fact that | remember such a
simple comment all these years later suggests just how potent sincerity can be.

But it wasn't just a question of what she said. Her actions reinforced her words over and over
again. She never once missed an appointment... In our very first meeting, she asked me what
sort of contact I'd like from her. | was, | remember, reluctant to say, unwilling, after the day
ospital, to find myself turned away again, but Bernadette persisted. ‘Well, | suppose, ideally, I'd
ike to see you every week; | ventured. | waited for the world to end. That's fine; Bernadette said.

Bernadette's commitment, her refusal to budge, her utter reliability, showing up week after week
wherever | was, in hospital or out of it, her consummate patience, the sheer amount of time she
was willing to offer - all these were critical in building the trust we needed to work together.

My relationship with Bernadette has been through many different phases over the years.
One of the great benefits of social work is its flexibility. Early on, | needed more practical help;
ater, as | returned to work, she offered me a great deal of support in making the transition.
Crucially, Bernadette recognised that the time someone begins to walk unaided is not the time to
throw away the crutches.

domineering attitude but were usually sensitive, responsive and human. Even ward domestics

74 Division of Clinical Psychology


10.3 Work and employment

Work and/or education are often particularly important. People who are under-occupied are much
more likely than others to experience recurring problems, and our sense of identity is also often
bound up with the voluntary or paid work that we do. Helping people to find and keep good
employment, education or other roles that they find meaningful should therefore be a core task for
mental health workers.”

Most people who have experienced psychosis want to work, but they are one of the most under-
employed groups in the UK: approximately 90 per cent of those in contact with specialist mental
health services are unemployed.” This is very significant because there is evidence that for many
eople, finding or getting back to meaningful work or other valued activity can have a greater
ositive impact than any ‘treatment.” People sometimes need help to get into work and it is vital
that services provide support with this. NICE recommends that services should offer people
tailored help with finding and keeping good employment. The most effective approach appears to
e ‘Individual Placement and Support’? where the service first helps someone find suitable work as
quickly as possible, and then supports them to keep it.°’””* This approach can be successful even

or people who are still struggling with on-going and sometimes disabling experiences. If the
erson is not able to do paid work, then voluntary work or other meaningful activity such as
education can also be very important. Again, everyone is different and it is very important that

eople are not pressured to return to work.

my condition and although my colleagues knew about my health problems, it was never an issue

James Wooldridge ”

One of the major considerations for people who have experienced mental health problems is
whether or not to inform existing or potential employers. In some cases people have good reason
to fear unfair discrimination as many cases of this have been documented, despite legislation
outlawing discrimination on grounds of disability and requiring employers to make ‘reasonable
adjustments:**' There is an obligation to respond truthfully to direct questions from potential
employers concerning any existing conditions prior to accepting a post. Where this information is
not specifically requested by employers then employees are not legally required to volunteer it.”

Understanding Psychosis 75


10.4 Help with organisation and motivation

The majority of people who hear distressing voices or hold beliefs that others consider ‘delusional’
nevertheless function well in their lives. However, some people experience ongoing problems such
as difficulties organising their thoughts and motivating themselves. Sometimes people can become
isolated or find it hard to look after themselves properly. In traditional clinical language, such
difficulties have sometimes been referred to as ‘negative symptoms. Sometimes they can be
reactions to, or ways of coping with voices or paranoia. Sometimes they are related to prescribed or
other drugs.” They can also be related to the person's situation, for example living in an
unstimulating environment where there are limited opportunities to engage in meaningful activity
or where people have been given the message that their problems are likely to be permanent and
disabling.”

It is important for workers to focus on people's strengths rather than on problems. For example,
one study found that nearly half of people with a mental health diagnosis who were successful
in employment had previously been told by a clinician that they would never work again, a so-
called ‘prognosis of doom:* Naturally, when people are given such a hopeless message they are
likely to feel more apathetic and withdrawn, and find it harder to motivate themselves. This can
create a vicious circle. It is important for all concerned to remember that most people who
experience voices or have ‘delusional’ beliefs go on to lead successful lives.

There are a number of strategies that can be helpful. For example, ‘behavioural activation’ focuses
on people's own interests and goals. Workers help the person to identify and plan how to reach
these, and to deal with pitfalls on the way. Psychological approaches such as cognitive behaviour
therapy can sometimes help by addressing worries about the new work or other activity (see below).
An approach called ‘cognitive remediation’ (see section 11) can help people to increase their problem
solving, memory and planning skills and work towards things they really want or need to do.

Some people who experience continued distress or confusion may need ongoing support in order
to live the kinds of lives they want to lead. Just as people with physical disabilities require
environmental adaptation and prosthetic aids, so too people who are disabled by persistent
distressing experiences or beliefs may require ongoing aids. For example, some people may need
reminding about things or help with planning; others may need practical help with household
tasks, with sorting out benefits or emotional support.

10.5 Getting help early

‘Early intervention’ aims to prevent or reduce the severity of problems before they are fully
developed and is recommended by NICE.” Many areas now have specialist services which offer help
to young people who are experiencing problems for the first time. The Schizophrenia Commission®®
found that these services are popular and recommended that they should be extended. Many offer
practical or psychological help in the first instance, rather than rather neuroleptic medication with
its attendant risks.” °

10.6 Help at times of crisis

Many people need help only occasionally when their problems become so severe that they, or their
family and friends, feel unable to cope. When it is friends or relatives who feel that help is needed,
workers need to bear in mind that those making this suggestion may have been coping for some
time, and try to understand why help is being sought now. What do the friends/relatives and the
potential service user actually feel would be helpful at this point? Is it possible to negotiate a
‘contract’ with commonly agreed goals? There is a need for creative responses to such situations,
which build on what service users themselves say is helpful.** Sometimes the only help available is
admission to an acute psychiatric ward, and sometimes not even that: ward closures have led to a
situation where very distressed people sometimes have to wait for many hours in Accident and
Emergency departments or sometimes even police cells.**“* Whilst many people are greatly helped
by a period of time in hospital, this is not the case for everyone. Sometimes acute wards operate on
a simplistic ‘illness model’ where staff see their main role as administering medication and keeping
the person safe until the drugs ‘work’ People sometimes have little opportunity to talk about the
reason for their admission and can be left feeling powerless and confused. Many people find acute
psychiatric wards frightening and unhelpful.” Recent initiatives have attempted to improve things,
for example the ‘Star Wards’ project which provides ward staff with ‘ideas and inspiration, not
standards and compulsion’.

Help at times of crisis

What helps people hold steady in crisis and during periods of severe distress? Presumably all the
people who are not in the mental health system have found a way of doing this - probably
through the meaning they attach to the experience. Practical things are very important to help
you keep steady and to ground yourself again as a person and in the social world. You need
workers that you can trust to accompany you through the experience and who you can check
things out with. So relationships are key.

Laura Lea, contributor

We should not, as a society, be leaving people with urgent mental health needs isolated,
frightened and unsupported in impersonal hospital settings. We should not be traumatising
those who use these services to such an extent that they would do anything not to return. Our
services should not be giving people a sense of abandonment.

MIND, from Listening to Experience ”’

It became clear that it is not procedural approaches (such as diagnosis or care plan) which set
the tone of an admission, but human contact with staff. Even the briefest of human
communication had a disproportionately powerful and positive effect if it was based on an
empathetic approach. We found this even when patients felt they were suffering delusions or
were closed down and uncommunicative.

Neil Springham and Ami Woods, researchers on acute mental health wards *

A range of alternatives to acute psychiatric wards have been developed.“ These include crisis
resolution/home treatment teams, non-hospital crisis houses such as crisis houses,” "' ‘recovery
houses’? and a host family scheme in Hertfordshire. There are also examples of crisis services run
by service users and ex-users, for example the Wokingham Crisis House™ or the Leeds Survivor Led
Crisis Service.®* Crisis houses are very popular with those who use them. There are still very few,
however, and more are urgently needed.

Workers should help every service user who wants it to draw up an ‘advance directive’ stating what
he or she wants to happen should a crisis occur in which he or she is considered temporarily unable
to exercise appropriate judgement. Professionals who work in crisis services should routinely
inquire about these.

All service users should also have access to independent advocacy.”

10.7 Keeping safe

10.7.1 Self neglect, self harm and suicide

When people are in a state of distress and confusion they can sometimes need help to maintain an
adequate diet, or look after their home. Someone who is confused is also likely to be at risk of
exploitation and abuse from other people.

Some people in acute distress harm or even try to kill themselves. There is a debate within services
about the best way to respond. Traditionally both self-harm and suicide attempts have been seen

mattress in NHS pyjamas, queuing up for meds three times a day, listening to the screams of my
fellow patients being held down and forcibly injected. | undoubtedly would have done, were it
not for the fact that | happen to live in the catchment area for one of the only two women's
crisis centres in the country.

When Drayton Park opened in 1995, it was truly innovative: a residential service, designed and
run exclusively for women, and aiming to offer an alternative to acute psychiatric admission.
When | first went there, a year or so later, | remember my amazement, bordering on glee, at the

huge saggy sofas, the home-cooked food, my room (my own room, ensuite, with a key!) and the

Chatting with the other women, comparing our past experience, you could feel the disbelief in
the air, that glazed look people's eyes take on as they sense the stocks of their own self-worth
start to rise. We thought we were in at the start of a whole new movement, a revolution, that
Drayton Parks would be springing up right across the country. The fact that, 10 years later, there's
only one other comparable service - Foxley Lane, part of the Maudsley Hospital and, like Drayton
Park, also in London - is disappointing to say the least. To my mind, it's disgraceful.

as ‘symptoms’ and services have used coercive measures to prevent them. Most of us agree that
services need to protect people from taking their own lives when they are confused and not in
their normal frame of mind. However, in most other circumstances there is acceptance of the need
for ‘positive risk taking’ - people who use services have a right to take risks, make their own
choices and learn from mistakes just like anyone else. Indeed taking away people's liberty and right
to make their own choices risks making them feel even more hopeless.

10.7.2 Risk to other people
As we stated above, the idea that people who experience psychosis are likely to be violent is a myth.
Nevertheless, there have been instances of people attacking others, usually those with whom they
have most contact, including family members and mental health staff. Sometimes people are
detained for long periods because of concerns about possible risk or dangerousness. It has
sometimes been assumed that violence is directly linked to the person's experiences, for example if
voices tell someone to do something (‘command hallucinations’, in medical language). However,
such instances actually seem to be quite rare. Much more commonly, people who are violent are
responding to the same things that might lead to violence in other settings, particularly when
people are feeling powerless. For example, the majority of violent incidents on acute mental health
wards happen after staff limit someone's freedom in some way, for example by denying a request,
placing a restriction on them, or insisting they take medication.” Staff should be trained in different
ways to negotiate during disputes and resolve conflicts. This should include role playing having one's
freedom restricted and learning how to empathise with people when they are overwhelmed with
fearful or angry feelings. Services should also offer help to families in this regard.

Understanding Psychosis 79


10.7.3 Risk of harm from services

Whilst many people have good experiences of services and professionals, all treatments bring with
them the risk of doing harm as well as good. The negative effects of psychiatric drugs and other
aspects of mental health services, for example the over-use of restraint in hospitals particularly
with certain people such as black men and young men generally, are well documented.” These
problems are often under-recognised and understated by professionals, perhaps because they see it
as their role to persuade people to engage with services. However, mental health services are
unique in that people can be compelled to use them under mental health legislation. This means
that those of us who work in services have an ethical responsibility to do all we can to keep people
safe from the harm that services can do.

Some of the harm that services sometimes do is related to the unrealistic expectations that we have
of them as a society. This leads to a ‘risk-averse’ culture where workers themselves fear being blamed
or criticised if something goes wrong. Together with the false assumption sometimes made that
persuading people to take medication is an effective way of keeping them and others safe, this can
have quite negative consequences. For example, in some services professionals who fear being
criticised if anything goes wrong become over-focused on insisting that people take medication.”

As we outline in Section 12, there is large individual variation in response to medication. A more
sophisticated approach is badly needed.

10.7.4 Compulsion: using mental health legislation

Current legislation allows for people to be kept in hospital and even administered medication
against their will if they are judged to be ‘mentally disordered’ and to pose a risk to themselves or
others. We need to remember how serious a decision this is, and how distressing it can be. The
numbers of people subject to compulsion have been rising year-on-year and we view this with
grave concern.” The number of compulsory admissions is now double what it was in the 1980s
and in many hospitals the majority of people are being held against their will. Although it was.
hoped that the controversial introduction of ‘community treatment orders’ would reduce this
number, they have been largely ineffective in preventing admissions.”

As we noted above, people from disadvantaged backgrounds, and particularly from black and
minority ethnic communities are more likely than others to experience compulsion, both in terms
of detention and forced medication. Young men of African or African Caribbean heritage are at
greatest risk.””'”? Services need to be aware of this tendency and take active steps to ensure that
everyone is treated fairly.

There is an argument that by keeping people against their will in wards which are often unpleasant
and sometimes frightening, and where often the only help on offer is medication with distressing
side effects, we are failing to uphold the basic ethical principle of ‘reciprocity’, namely that ‘where
society imposes an obligation on an individual to comply with a programme of treatment or care, it
should impose a parallel obligation on the health and social care authorities to provide safe and
appropriate services, including on-going care following discharge from compulsion’?

The British Psychological Society has argued that decisions should be explicitly based on someone's
ability to make the relevant decisions (‘capacity’) rather than on whether he or she has a
psychiatric diagnosis.” The law in Scotland makes this clear but this is not yet the case in England
or Wales. Many admissions involve compulsory administration of medication, sometimes by force.
There is a debate about whether such measures are ever justified.”"°7"”

‘The ‘big, bad black man syndrome’... you're more likely to be heavily medicated or physically
restrained. You expect it!

Anon *

‘0 have strange experiences or ones that others do not understand and which are acted upon,
immediately make others frightened. When people are frightened they want ‘something to be
done’ If they are frightened but ‘sane’ by common consent in relation to agents of the State
(such as the police, social workers and psychiatrists) then they will usually successfully find ways
of reducing their anxiety by getting something done. Once a person then becomes a psychotic
atient in the system, anxiety there will ensure that professionals also take action. They will
medicate rather than wait and see, and if in doubt they will use legal powers or threaten to use
them. This is why it is hard to find a non-medicated patient and why the Mental Health Act or its
threat is used to control an unpredictable situation.

But this is the twist in the tail... if we are to move to a consensual, user-centred and voluntaristic
ethos, where people are given genuine choices (the rhetoric of mental health Trusts not just this
report) then there is a crucial consequence of knee-jerk routines of medication plus legal control.
t will alienate patients and traumatise them when coerced, and thereby defeat the good
intentions implied in the rhetoric. The power of the ‘sane’ over the ‘insane’ must be used very
judiciously if that rhetoric is to start to become a reality.

Section 11: Talking — psychological help

Key points

Psychological therapies - talking treatments - are helpful for many people.

he National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has reviewed the evidence and
recommends that everyone with a diagnosis of schizophrenia should be offered talking
therapy. However, most are currently unable to access it.

he most researched therapy is cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT). Trials have found that on
average, people gain as much benefit from CBT as from medication.

‘Family interventions’ have also been extensively researched and many people find family
meetings very helpful.
alking therapy is very popular: demand vastly outstrips supply in the NHS.

here is an urgent need for further investment in psychological approaches to ensure that all
services come up to the standard of the best, and so that people can be offered choice.

Different approaches suit different people. Not everyone finds formal psychological therapy
elpful and some find it positively unhelpful. We need to respect people's choices.

All staff need to be trained in the principles of a psychological approach as outlined in this
report so that it can inform not only formal therapy but also the whole culture of services and
every conversation that happens within them.

82 Division of Clinical Psychology


Introduction

It is vital for people to be able to talk and think about their experiences in a calm, supportive and
non-judgemental atmosphere. This underpins all forms of helping and should be the first thing that
any worker or service offers. Providing this opportunity is often the most important thing that any
mental health worker can do.

Talking therapy, also called psychological therapy, is essentially a more formalised opportunity for
people to talk and think about their experiences. It helps people to make sense of their experiences,
work out what they mean for them and find out what helps.

The idea that it is possible to understand ‘psychotic’ experiences psychologically - in other words,
in the same way that we understand other human experiences - is transforming mental health
services. Some of the contributors to this report have been at the forefront of this development.
One important practical consequence has been that psychological therapies are now more widely
available, although there is a long way to go before they are available to everyone.' In particular,
there is evidence that people from BME and other socially disadvantaged backgrounds are much
less likely than others to be offered psychological therapy. Culturally informed services, able to draw
on a range of understandings of distress are also unavailable in many areas.”*

All psychological therapy depends on a trusting, collaborative working relationship between
therapist and client. In some cases this is probably the most important ‘ingredient’;* and it is vital
that people are able to find a therapist with whom they feel comfortable. Different approaches
also suit different people, depending on their preferences and on what appears to be keeping the
roblem going - the ‘formulation’ referred to above.

alking therapy may be offered individually, in groups or to families. In this latter case it is often
called ‘family intervention’: this was described in Section 9 above. Whilst psychological therapy has
traditionally been offered in conjunction with medication, recent research suggests that it could
erhaps be helpful as an alternative for some people.**”*

t is crucial that therapists work towards the person's own goals rather than making assumptions
about what is important. For example, reducing ‘symptoms’ such as voices may not be the person's

main goal. Clinical psychologist Professor Paul Chadwick describes the need for ‘radical
collaboration.’ Based upon the person-centred approach of Carl Rogers” ‘radical collaboration’ is
ased on the following assumptions:

Understanding Psychosis 83


Assumptions underlying ‘radical collaboration’
in psychological therapy

1. The core of people is essentially positive. Given certain therapeutic conditions (e.g. active
listening and exploration of new possibilities within a transparent process) clients
experiencing psychosis can move towards emotional wellbeing and acceptance.

2. ‘Psychotic’ experience is continuous with ordinary experience and part of the human
condition - therefore moving away from illness as defining.

3. Therapists’ responsibility is to radical collaboration and acceptance.

4. Commitment is to a process, not a clinical outcome. Therapists do not assume
responsibility for a client's progress, as this responsibility is shared and learning takes place
irrespective of outcome.

5. Effective therapy depends upon understanding sources of distress, not sources of psychosis.
It is not necessary to search for causes in order to understand a person's distress and their
response to ‘psychotic’ experiences.

6. Therapists aim is to be themselves more fully with client. Meeting the client as a person
(rather than a set of problems) by being a person oneself. By being him/herself more fully

the therapist is modelling interpersonal behaviour and reducing the likelihood of the
conditional acceptance that the client may routinely experience. Working with people who
have ‘psychotic’ experiences can be stressful. Workers themselves need regular supervision
and emotional support in order to maintain an open and collaborative approach towards
service users.

Professor Paul Chadwick, Clinical Psychologist "

Most of this is common to all good psychological therapy. The different types of therapy have more
in common than they have differences. All are essentially an opportunity for a conversation
between two or more people, talking through the problems and working out what may be
contributing and what might help. A good working relationship between the people involved is
vital.

With all psychological therapies it is important to remember that:

e Engaging with therapy is a choice. Where people feel that it is not for them, or not the right
time, this should be respected.

e Unlike medication, therapy can only be offered to people, not imposed or forced on them.

. Different people will have different goals for therapy - for example, they may want to
address low mood or self-esteem rather than voices or paranoia directly.

e As with other ‘treatments’, therapy can sometimes have ‘side effects’ or even do harm.

e Even an excellent therapist will not be a good fit for every client.

e Even the most ‘evidence-based therapies don't help everyone. People themselves are the best
judges of whether a particular therapy or therapist is helping them.

There are some differences between approaches, and these are described below. The most researched
form of therapy is cognitive behaviour therapy or CBT, and this is discussed first. However, different
things suit different people. People may need to try different things to find what works for them.

84 Division of Clinical Psychology


11.1 Cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT)

CBT (in this context sometimes called CBTp, short for CBT for psychosis) is a structured talking
therapy which looks at the way that people understand and react to their experiences.”

The experience of CBT

Starting therapy with Paul - the clinical psychologist - was terrifying. | sat, avoiding eye contact,
even avoiding looking up from the ground. Often | shook and often jumped at any unexpected
sound. | was terrified. But it soon became clear that Paul was not interested in my psychiatric
abel. And it was also clear he was prepared to address the issue of my voices without belittling
them or treating them as weird. The first session the voices were shouting and it was hard to
concentrate. Paul recognised this and actually asked me what was going on with the voices. |
didn't feel at all ‘loony: Paul made me feel that | was of some importance. Paul spoke - | needed
im to speak and put me at my ease. Previously | had seen a psychotherapist who waited for me
to speak and often would not reply even when | had braved to utter a word.

he collaborative relationship | have with Paul gives me confidence that my ideas, as well as his,
are important. | get to say what | want to work on - | have some power in this relationship. Paul
gives me feedback and some idea of his reaction and tells me what areas he might like us to
cover. He does this whilst giving me a lot of power and | feel that | am in control.

alking about the ‘voices thing’ became open and normal. It has not been shied away from. We
ave discussed: where the voices come from, the effect they have on me, how the voices feed on
my present feelings and how | can, hopefully, partially control them.

We have discussed coping strategies, some successful, some not so, and some just plain silly
humming whilst they are speaking: | could only think of Dionne Warwick songs!). One long-term
strategy - challenging the voices - has proved to be the hardest but the most successful. As soon
as a voice pops into my head | try to test out, with previous evidence, what the voice is saying.
he voices often come up and interrupt sessions. We don't just ignore them, we deal with them.

tt now seems to me that the voices always feed off negative images | have about myself.
can think about the voices being a by-product of my own self-image.

Understanding Psychosis 85


The main assumption behind CBT is that distress is at least partly related to the way people
interpret, make sense of and respond to things that happen." The therapist empathises with the
person's distress and stresses that it is understandable in the circumstances. They try to help the
person work out what might be going on, and check out their fears in a safe way. They help the
person to identify any vicious circles and how they might be able to avoid or break out of them.
The person might begin to make links with things that have happened to them previously. For
example, they might realise that traumatic or threatening experiences in their past make them
more likely to interpret an event as threatening. They might be able to develop alternative
explanations, and perhaps to see patterns - for example that they tend to notice more worrying
things when they are already feeling anxious. The therapist works with the person to develop a
‘formulation’ along the lines described in Section 7 (‘How Dan came to understand his problems’)
to summarise their joint understanding of what might be going on -- including any vicious circles
that might be operating - and of possibilities for change. Different people have different goals for
therapy depending on their priorities and the nature of their difficulties. The therapist might work
with the person to examine and test their beliefs (for example, that someone or something is trying
to harm them, or that the voices that they are hearing have power over them). Alternatively, if
someone does not wish to examine their beliefs in this way, the therapist might work within the
person's own frame of reference to help them find ways to reduce their distress. For example, if
someone believes that he or she is being watched by the CIA and does not wish to examine this
belief, it might be more useful to think together about coping strategies. The person might try
wearing dark glasses, perhaps, so that they feel less anxious about being seen, and can still do
necessary things like going shopping."*

People might prioritise, and so use therapy to address different problems: for example, low mood,
distressing beliefs, distressing voices, how they feel about their experiences and what they mean to
them, coping with aspects of life that they are finding particularly hard, or how they feel about
themselves.'* Work is also continuously ongoing to improve and develop therapy and to find ways
of helping different people: people in acute crisis and people who want to address longer-term
issues, people who hear voices and people who have distressing beliefs, people who are taking
medication and those who choose not to, people whose problems are closely linked to their mood,
people for whom disrupted sleep is a major issue, people who have problems with alcohol or
recreational drugs, people who prefer to come on their own, and people who prefer a group
approach.'®” As we learn more about the emotional, thinking and other processes that can be
involved in different problems, we are able to develop more specific ways of offering help.

Cognitive behaviour therapy

The CBT enabled me to get in control of what was in my head. Everything is less chaotic and my
mind is now freed up to do other things.

My therapist was a kind, warm woman and she helped me make maps of my thinking. Just
seeing down on paper that my thoughts follow a set course every time was a revelation.
Negative thinking is not only seductive, it is a road made of quicksand. You will be swallowed up

by it if you give any weight to it. CBT gave me a crossroad to choose from, and | chose positive
thinking and action, even though it was easier to water the terrible and beautiful flower that is

psychosis... In a nutshell, ten years ago | would have been one of those people who said ‘yes,
assisted suicide for the mentally ill is a good, necessary thing. But today | don't. Why not?
Because | have changed. Change is possible. And if it is possible, how could | possibly advocate
assisted suicide?

Dolly Sen *

11.1.1 Effectiveness of cognitive behaviour therapy

There is a consistent evidence base suggesting that many people find CBTp helpful.'°”? Other forms
of therapy can also be helpful, but so far it is CBTp that has been most intensively researched. There
have now been several meta-analyses (studies using a statistical technique that allows findings
from various trials to be averaged out) looking at its effectiveness. Although they each yield
slightly different estimates, there is general consensus that on average, people gain around as
much benefit from CBT as they do from taking psychiatric medication.2:279747575

Although psychological therapies don't help everyone, for others they can make a huge difference
to their lives.” Even where they don't reduce the frequency or intensity of experiences, they often
help reduce distress, which of course is what many people are hoping for. They can also help people
to find ways of achieving their goals and getting on with their lives even if their experiences (for
example voices) continue. Sometimes changes are even visible in neuroimaging studies (scans) of
the brain.”

The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) considers the evidence strong enough
to recommend that everyone with a diagnosis of schizophrenia should be offered CBT. NICE
recommends that people should be offered at least 16 one-to-one sessions over a minimum of six
months.” However, this is far from being the case everywhere: indeed the Schizophrenia
Commission found that only one in ten people who could benefit from it have access to good
CBTp*. We view this with grave concern - indeed, it has been described as scandalous.”

There is now a competence framework which describes the knowledge and skills needed by
practitioners of CBTp.” There is consensus about some of the necessary ‘active ingredients’,° which
are reflected in the competence framework. Without them, therapy has the potential to be
unhelpful or even damaging. They are listed in the text box, together with quotes from people who
have experienced them as part of therapy.

The necessary ‘active ingredients’ of CBT for psychosis

Offering choice over when and whether to undertake therapy:

To be honest there would have been times where there was no way | would have engaged with it
or benefited from it... | think you've got to be ready and motivated for it because there is quite a
lot of thinking and you need to be fairly open minded.

Collaboration:

It was very much a partnership between myself and the psychologist. It was really put to me as
team work, which | thought was great. It wasn't that someone else has an agenda... it was
centred around me which I'd not come across before.

Not seeing psychotic experiences as crazy or wrong:

..all these thoughts, | was thinking when | felt fine, oh my god they're crazy but [therapist]
helped me to see that the thoughts weren't crazy, after looking at what happened.

Using formulations to understand the links between thoughts, feelings and behaviour:
..like maps of my mood and little things about different parts of your life and how they can fit
together. He would draw little diagrams that made sense to me and I'd be like ‘Yeah, yeah,
you're right:

Examining and testing out ways of thinking:

| think the evidence thing's kind of good... you have to sort of work out ‘Well, is it likely to be
real?’ Like if you think, say, people taking thoughts out of my head... well what's the proof that
they are?

Trying things out in the real world between therapy sessions:

| feel if | hadn't done the homework that | had, then, and showed up to the sessions as well, |
think it would have taken me a lot longer.

11.1.2 Less formal support drawing on CBT related ideas

Even though unfortunately the majority of service users in the UK still have no access to CBT or
indeed any formal talking therapy, they do all have conversations with mental health workers. The
ideas contained in this report, including those drawn from CBT, can be very useful in informing
those conversations. Part of the motivation for writing this report was to make the ideas more
widely available. We hope that all workers will read and discuss it as part of their training, and that
families and friends will use it to inform their conversations.

Mental health staff can help people identify and implement strategies, perhaps ones that others
have found helpful,” or which are used by self-help groups such as the Hearing Voices Network.
Examples might include:

e ‘Coping strategy enhancement’ whereby people build upon their own repertoire of ways of
coping such as listening to music, exercise or standing up to voices.”
e ‘Behavioural activation’ and ‘activity scheduling’ - these involve planning your time and

increasing activity levels, strategies which many people have found helpful.”

e Problem solving - identifying a specific problem, identifying possible solutions, choosing one
to try, and then reviewing how it went.

e Finding ways to reduce stress.

e ‘Relapse prevention’ - people who have experienced crises in the past identify warning signs
and how to act on them to reduce the likelihood of future crises.

e Focusing on sleep. Poor sleep and insomnia can lead to, or increase problems such as
paranoia. Strategies focused on bedtime routine, relaxation and being active in the daytime
can decrease both insomnia and paranoia. Many people find this approach helpful,
sometimes more so than addressing the paranoia directly.

At the moment the biggest evidence base is for CBT. However, other approaches can also be helpful
and many of these are currently being researched to find out how many people they help, how, to
what extent, and how they can be improved. Some are described below.

11.2 Cognitive remediation

In addition to experiences such as voices or paranoia, some people experience problems with
structuring their thoughts or with memory, problem solving or planning. An approach called
‘cognitive remediation’ has been developed which addresses these problems directly. It can help
with ‘real life’ challenges such as finding and keeping a job**“' and can sometimes be useful
alongside other psychological therapies, reducing the number of sessions people need.”

11.3 Trauma focused therapy and psychodynamic approaches

As we saw in Section 6, many people who hear voices or feel paranoid have survived traumatic or
abusive experiences, and so it can be helpful for therapy (including CBT) to focus not only on the
here-and-now but also on the psychological effects of trauma. Many psychologists are skilled in
working therapeutically with people who have survived trauma, including working with flashbacks
and dissociation (dissociation means mentally distancing yourself from what is happening, a
common way that people cope with trauma). As we saw in section 6, there is a great deal of
overlap between these experiences and ‘psychosis’: indeed there have been suggestions that they
are essentially the same thing.” Psychologists have adapted trauma-focused approaches to therapy
in order to help people who experience psychosis.**°*°*7

Understanding Psychosis 89


Psychodynamic therapy also attends to how things that have happened in our lives continue to
affect us. This approach focuses both on difficult things that have happened and also on our
relationships, including the way we relate to ourselves as well as to others.

After much searching, she finally encounters truly wise people, brave souls who have the courage
and integrity to witness her truth. As much as it pains them, they listen to her stories from the
underworld, and hear of the terrible suffering that many children have endured. Together they
walk down a long winding, road, back to the underworld, where a process of truth and
reconciliation, of listening, bearing witness and of facing the horrors of the past can take place.
The world will never look the same again to them for they have seen the underworld. And even
though she is a freak of nature they love her and they hold her and they soothe her and
gradually she begins to feel human. She begins to feel real. She discovers that she isn't alone in
quite the same way that she always had been. She begins to accept support as an act of courage
and commitment to life and the future. Only then can she begin to truly mourn for all she has
lost. She did not know it was possible to cry so many tears... then one day she suddenly knows
what she has always known. Her voices are more than just voices. They are many different selves,
with different names, ages, experiences, feelings, identities; dissociated selves that became
internal representations of her external world. Rather than trying to eradicate these different
parts of her even though they sometimes frighten her, she begins to embrace them. Each is part
of the whole of her. She begins to listen to them and understand them and to greet them with
compassion and understanding. To her delight, they begin to teach her the mysteries of healing,
alchemy and magic. Gradually she feels less ashamed of who she is and begins to marvel at how
creative she has been in surviving the horrors of the underworld.

Jacqui Dillon, from The Tale of An Ordinary Girl *

11.4 Acceptance and commitment therapy and mindfulness

Some people find using mindfulness meditation helpful, or the related approach of acceptance and
commitment therapy. These approaches involve noticing or becoming more aware of thoughts
and experiences and accepting them as things that come and go, as just thoughts rather than as
facts. Some psychologists now offer guided mindfulness sessions tailored to the needs of people
who have experienced psychosis." Acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) is based on the
idea that we all experience distress, and that rather than putting our energy into fighting and
trying to control it, it can help if we are able to develop acceptance of our emotional pain and
focus on what is important to us. Many psychologists draw on these ideas alongside those
described above.

11.5 Narrative and systemic therapies

The idea behind narrative therapy is that our lives and identities are shaped by stories that we
develop about ourselves and that others develop about us.” Narrative therapy groups help their
members to fully describe their rich stories and to overcome the effects of narrow and negative
stories that are told about them (for example, being a ‘chronic schizophrenic’). An example is the

90 Division of Clinical Psychology


Power to our Journeys group described by narrative therapist Michael White. Similarly, systemic
therapy emphasises the role played by the ‘systems’ that we are part of, such as our families or
wider society. It looks at the ideas, beliefs and stories that are around within them, and how we
each negotiate our place and our relationships. It can often be useful for family meetings (section
9.1.1.1) to draw on these ideas.

When you're in the acute phase you're lost in your experiences and in the mythic story that
you've developed to make sense of them. You need help to navigate them. The nature of this
story, the meaning it provides and your relationship to it (how true is this and how do | tell what
is truth?) is key to developing a way of living successfully, or not, and recovering well or not.
Essentially the medical model is a very successful story that is offered to people and comes with
supporting goods of medication and the mythology of the psychiatrist and his skills. (This is not

to say that this story or mythology is all myth.) Of course, having just this story and meaning for
the experiences is not helpful. It rules out other meanings which are important - particularly the
important one that we have responsibility for our own complex story and medication is not
usually going to solve the whole problem.

11.6 Voice dialoguing

Voice dialoguing is a relatively new approach which can be helpful for some people who hear
distressing voices. It is based on the idea that the different voices often reflect different aspects of
ourselves or experiences we have had. A therapist (called a ‘facilitator’ in this context) asks
questions of the different ‘voices' in order to help the person explore, and if helpful to change,
their relationship to them. Some researchers are exploring using avatars to represent voices.”

11.7 Helping families

Section 9 described the ways in which services can help family and friends to support someone,
including offering regular meetings where the whole family can discuss things. There is now very
good evidence that many people find such ‘family interventions for psychosis’ extremely helpful.°°°"
NICE recommends that this kind of help should be offered to everyone with a diagnosis of
psychosis or schizophrenia who lives with or is in close contact with family members, together with
particular support for the family members who are most closely involved in helping their loved
one.”

11.8 Increasing Access to Psychological Therapy

Unfortunately, despite the high demand for psychological therapy and the evidence of its
effectiveness, services have been slow to catch up and the vast majority of people still have no
access to it. Despite NICE recommendations,” there are still many, many service users who request
therapy and for whom it might even be lifesaving, but who cannot access it on the NHS. Even
those who do have often waited for years: Dolly Sen, for example, talks about a ‘wasted decade’
of her life before she was offered psychological therapy.”

recommendations:

Services should:

. ‘Offer cognitive behavioural therapy to all people with psychosis or schizophrenia.
This can be started either during the acute phase or later, including in inpatient settings:
. ‘Offer family intervention to all families of people with psychosis or schizophrenia who

live with or are in close contact with the service user. This can be started either during
the acute phase or later, including in inpatient settings:

In 2012 the influential ‘Schizophrenia Commission’® noted that ‘It is unacceptable that only 1 in 10
of those who could benefit get access to true CBT, despite it being recommended by NICE? Many
service user groups and mental health charities are also actively campaigning for talking therapy to
be more widely available.” The government has expressed its intention to ‘improve access to
psychological therapy for severe mental illness’® but currently only a few sites are funded. More
investment is urgently needed.

11.9 Finding an approach that suits you

Although nearly everyone benefits from talking about their experiences, and many people benefit
from formal psychological therapy, this is not the case for everyone. Some people prefer more
informal support from friends, family and mental health staff.

As with medication, it is possible for therapy to do harm as well as good.” It can be difficult to talk
about painful issues. Sometimes people receive incompetent or inadequate therapy, or even meet
abusive therapists. It is an unfortunate but very real fact that a small number of people in every
profession sometimes cross the boundary into inappropriate behaviour. NHS Trusts, professional
bodies such as the British Psychological Society, the Health and Care Professions Council and the
police rightly take such abuses very seriously.

People from ethnic and other minority backgrounds may find it particularly difficult to find a
therapist who is sufficiently aware of our culture and of the specific issues we may face.” As we
noted earlier, western mental health services have sometimes ignored the fact that different
cultures have different frameworks of understanding with respect to the nature and origins of
mental health problems, and what is likely to help.” Western approaches to therapy tend to assume
that the causes of people's problems lie in their mind or brain, and require help from outside
experts. However, not everyone sees things in this way and many people might see distress as say,
more related to spiritual conflicts, or as arising from the need to make changes in society or
acknowledge past hurts. They may place an emphasis on the role of the family, community elders
or healers. There is a debate about how much Western approaches to therapy can usefully be
adapted.””>

Different types of therapy also suit different people. People may need to try more than one approach,
and professionals need to respect people's decisions.

11.10 Conclusions

here is now overwhelming evidence that psychological approaches can be very helpful for people
who experience psychosis. However, there remains a wide variation in what is available in different
laces. Even the most successful approaches, such as early intervention and family work, are often
not available, and nine out of ten of those who could benefit have no access to CBT.” There is a
ressing need for all services to come up to the standard of the best and to offer people genuine
choices.” Perhaps most importantly, we need a culture change in services such that the
sychological understanding described in this report informs every conversation and every decision.

Section 12: Medication

Key points

Many people find that ‘antipsychotic’ medication helps make experiences such as hearing
voices less intense, frequent or distressing. It can be particularly useful at times of crisis when
the experiences can feel overwhelming.

However, the drugs appear to have a general rather than a specific effect: there is little
evidence that they are correcting an underlying biochemical abnormality.

There are significant risks as well as potential benefits, especially when people take medication
over many years.

Prescribers need to help people to weigh up the risks and benefits of taking particular drugs or
indeed taking medication at all. People need to be able to try things out and arrive at an
informed choice. Services should not pressurise people to take medication.

As we saw in Section 11, psychological therapies are still often not offered routinely. However,
nearly everyone who comes to services for help with voices or unusual beliefs is offered
medication. The most commonly prescribed drugs are those known as neuroleptics. These drugs
(sometimes called ‘antipsychotics’ or major tranquillisers) were first developed in the late 1940s
and have since been widely used to try and reduce ‘psychotic’ experiences. There are many types,
including chlorpromazine, thioridazine, trifluoperazine, sulpiride, haloperidol, flupenthixol and
fluphenazine. More recently, newer neuroleptics (for example, clozapine, risperidone, quetiapine
and olanzapine) have come into use. These are often referred to as ‘atypical antipsychotics.

12.1 How can medication help?

Many people find neuroleptic medication helpful, particularly in acute crises when experiences can feel
overwhelming. They can reduce the intensity of experiences and help make them less distressing. Some
people also find them helpful for a period afterwards, or even long-term, to make the experiences
feel more manageable and reduce the likelihood of them increasing in severity or intensity.

Whilst there is no doubt that many people find neuroleptic drugs helpful, there is some controversy
over how they work. Many appear to affect the neurotransmitter (brain chemical) dopamine,’ and
they are sometimes thought of - and often promoted by pharmaceutical companies - as specific
treatments for specific illnesses, perhaps by correcting some sort of chemical imbalance. However,
this idea is contested, and it has been suggested that the term ‘antipsychotic’ is rather misleading.’
In practice what they do appears to be more general, exerting a ‘damping down’ effect on thoughts
and emotions‘ in a comparable way to other psychoactive drugs such as diazepam (Valium).° This
can of course be very useful, particularly when someone is very agitated or is experiencing many
distressing thoughts. Some psychiatrists are now suggesting adopting a ‘drug-centred’ rather than
a ‘disease-centred' approach.® What this means is that medication can sometimes be helpful for
people who are in distress, but that is not the same as curing an illness or putting right a
biochemical abnormality or imbalance.

94 Division of Clinical Psychology


As with psychological therapies, some people benefit massively from taking medication and others
not at all. With both types of treatment, professionals should provide information about what is
available and about what research suggests others have found helpful. Then we need to support
people to try things and see what works for them.

12.2 Problems with ‘antipsychotic’ medication

12.2.1 Effectiveness

Until recently the ‘received wisdom' has been that everyone who experiences psychosis should take
medication long-term to reduce the likelihood of ‘relapse:'? However, opinion on this is changing. An
editorial in the British Journal of Psychiatry has suggested that the general effectiveness of
‘antipsychotic’ medication may have been over-estimated.'? A meta-analysis (which pools results
from many studies) suggested that many people experience only slight benefits and only about 20
per cent experience a significant improvement or prevention of reoccurrence. There appears to be
little difference in this regard between ‘old’ and the ‘new’ types of medication.'* Recent studies which
followed people's recovery over seven to 20 years found that although in the short term they had
more relapses, in the longer term people who reduced their dose or were able to cope without taking
medication tended to do better." °

12.2.2 Unwanted effects

Most drugs have unwanted effects (also called adverse effects or side effects) as well as desired
ones. Common unwanted effects of ‘antipsychotic’ medication include stiffness, weakness and
tremor (‘parkinsonism’), tension and restlessness (‘akathisia’) and muscle spasms. Trials with healthy
volunteers have suggested that neuroleptic medication can also cause the tiredness, apathy and
lethargy which are sometimes considered ‘negative symptoms of schizophrenia‘”” " Indeed, in a
recent study of people's experiences of taking both ‘old’ and ‘new’ types of neuroleptic, the
predominant effects that people reported were ‘sedation, cognitive impairment and emotional
flattening or indifference" Different drugs have slightly different side effects.”

Unwanted (‘side’) effects

With akathisia there is never any peace from this insistent urge to move, be it rock backwards and
forwards in a chair, shuffle around the wards, kneel and huddle in a chair or go for a walk. It is like
a tinnitus of the body; there is never a moment of inner silence. | remember one day staring into a
mirror on Ward 3. My eyeballs were bulging, my skin was greasy and grainy, my hair like rats’ tails,
| was stiffened and troubled by constipation and simultaneously racked by akathisia. | looked like
everybody's image of a mental patient - but it was entirely a medication effect.

An issue that has caused controversy recently is that of the likely effects of neuroleptics when they
are taken - as they often are - for many years. Some people find it helpful to take them long-term,
and in the past services have often recommended that people should do so if they have had a
significant ‘psychotic’ episode. However, recent research suggests that long-term use can
sometimes lead to health problems such as decreased brain volume” or heart problems.” This has
created a dilemma for prescribing clinicians. A leading researcher has recently concluded that
clinicians should prescribe them at the ‘lowest possible dosages.” Many people gain weight, and of
course being overweight brings its own problems and risks such as diabetes. Recent evidence
suggests when used long-term, unwanted effects can outweigh positive effects for many people.”
This is particularly important in view of the increasing evidence that people with a diagnosis of
schizophrenia have a significantly lower average life expectancy than others." The likely reasons for
this are complex, including increased suicide risk, frequent poverty and poorer physical health care
(there is evidence that health care workers can be prejudiced and sometimes miss problems). Whilst
one study found that taking psychiatric medication appeared to increase average life expectancy,”
for many people the opposite may be true.” Science journalist Robert Whitaker has drawn
attention to these issues in his books Mad in America® and Anatomy of an Epidemic.”

Being on medication can also have psychological effects. For example, the idea that it is
medication that makes things better can give the misleading message that there is little that
people can do to help themselves. It is important that workers think of, and present, medication as
only one of many things that might help.”

12.3 Collaborative decisions about medication

Through their training and their work in the field, professionals know what some people have
found helpful in the past. However, no prescriber is in a position to know whether neuroleptic
medication will help a particular individual, and if so which one, which dose, or taken at which
times. Neuroleptics can only be used pragmatically - trying a particular medication and seeing
what happens. We need to be honest and take a pragmatic (‘suck it and see’), collaborative
approach, talking through options and enabling the person to try different things to see what
helps.

12.3.1 Weighing up benefits and risks

In the past, when someone has decided to discontinue medication this has sometimes been seen as
‘lack of insight’ or perhaps as related to suspiciousness or paranoia. However, the British Journal of
Psychiatry editorial mentioned above’ suggests that for many people, it may be a rational choice
taken after weighing up the risks and benefits. It also suggests that it may be time to reappraise
the assumption that ‘antipsychotics’ must always be the first line of treatment for people
diagnosed with psychosis. Finally, it recommends that doctors should prescribe in a more
collaborative way, including explicit discussion of the possibility of not prescribing at all. In the
past, prescribers have sometimes tended to play down side effects. Given that neuroleptics can be
helpful but also often have unwanted effects, it might be useful to think of the decision about
taking them as analogous to a decision about undergoing chemotherapy for cancer, in other words
weighing the possible benefits against the likely drawbacks. Useful questions to ask might include:

e How do you think the medication is affecting your quality of life?
e What kinds of things it is making it easier or harder to do?
e How might we be able to keep track of its effects?

Recently a number of resources have been developed to provide information and support people in
deciding whether to continue taking medication, and to find alternative ways to stay well if they
decide to come off or cut down: see the resource list at the end of this report.

Important note:
It can be dangerous to stop medication suddenly if you have been taking it for some time.
Always discuss your decision with a clinician.

See www.comingoff.com* or www.mind.org.uk*’ for advice.

12.3.2 Finding the type of medication that suits you best

Finding medication which seems to work best for an individual person, with least unwanted effects,
can take time. We all have slightly different chemistries and different people react differently to
the same medication. Finding the one that works best involves a process of trial and error. The NICE
guideline suggests that if two different neuroleptics have proved ineffective, the person should be
offered clozapine.® This is because it is believed to work differently and some people find it more
helpful. However because it can have serious adverse effects in some people, and so needs close
monitoring including blood tests, it is particularly important that the person who will take it makes
the final decision.

98 Division of Clinical Psychology


12.3.3 Working out when to take medication

Many people find medication helpful at those times when experiences are most intense or
distressing. Afterwards, some people use them either prophylactically (taking them regularly to try
to reduce the likelihood of future episodes) or intermittently (when they feel unwell, distressed or
under stress). For some people, prophylactic medication appears to help prevent further distressing
episodes and hospital admissions.” Many people decide to take it long term to try to avoid these
problems. However, this is not the case for everyone and it is important that clinicians help people
to test out over time what works for them. It is vital that clinicians respect someone's decision if he
or she decides not to take medication or to try coming off, and support the person in this process.

Rufus May “

12.3.4 Finding the right dose
Although each medication comes with recommended doses, again it is often a question of the
clinician working with the person over time to find the most helpful dose.

There is no evidence that high doses of neuroleptics are more helpful than low doses,” but high doses can
cause more severe adverse effects. For this reason, the Royal College of Psychiatrists has
recommended that high doses should be used only under exceptional circumstances. Current NICE
guidelines recommend that only one neuroleptic should be used at any one time.* However, high
doses and multiple drugs actually appear to be used quite frequently, and this is something we view
with concern. An audit by the Royal College of Psychiatrists revealed that one in three people were
prescribed more than the maximum recommended daily dose and that 43 per cent of people were
on more than one neuroleptic drug.

Part 4: What we need to do differently

Understanding Psychosis 101


Section 13: What mental health services need to do
differently

Key points

Fundamental changes are required in the way we plan, commission and organise mental health
services.

Services should take as their starting point that mental health is a contested area and should
not insist that service users accept any one framework of understanding.

Professionals need to shift from seeing ourselves as treating disease to seeing ourselves as
providing skilled help and support to people who are experiencing understandable distress.

Service structures need to allow workers the flexibility to tailor help to the particular needs of
each person rather than offering standardised packages of care.

Fundamental changes are needed to many aspects of current services. Whilst some of these can be
achieved by individual professionals changing their practice, others require policy changes.’

A story

The woman presents her possession, the child, to a man who can only be the devil. Together they
laugh and they defile the child and rob her of her innocence... The survival strategies that she
unconsciously develops as a child create an illusion of control, an illusion that she has some
agency over what happens to her. Despite her abject helplessness, she utilises all the resources
available to her at the time - her mind, her body, her spirit - and she fights for her life. She
begins to hear voices; voices that talk to her, talk about her, who comfort her, protect her and
make her feel less alone. In time, they control and terrorise her but help her to stay alive...

In desperation, she seeks asylum in a place that is meant to provide sanctuary for her... she
begins to tell the gatekeepers at the asylum, who assure her that they are learned men, healers in
fact, about the children who have suffered in the underworld. To her astonishment, they
reiterate the words of the devil. There is no underworld. She is crazy. She is ill. She was born with
something wrong with her. She feels as if she has been slapped in the face, kicked while she is
down, re-abused. This is insult to injury. She is wild with outrage... The place that is meant to
provide her with sanctuary is the place that nearly drives her over the edge once and for all.

13.1 We need to move beyond the ‘medical model’

At least in the UK, most mental health services are currently based on the ‘medical model’ - the
assumption, common in many Western countries, that experiences such as hearing voices indicate
illness and result from some sort of problem with the brain. This idea is also enshrined in mental
health law and is the basis for compulsion. In the past many professionals have also believed that
people experiencing distressing voices or paranoia are unlikely to recover without treatment
(usually medication). This belief has led to a perceived ‘duty of care’ to provide treatment, and a
tendency to view someone who does not want the treatment being offered as lacking in insight. As
this report has shown, both of these assumptions are unfounded.

This basis needs to change. A more honest and helpful ‘guiding idea’ for services is this:

Mental health is a contested area. The experiences that are sometimes called mental illness,
schizophrenia or psychosis are very real. They can cause extreme distress and offering help and
support is a vital public service. We know something about the kinds of things that can
contribute to these experiences or cause them to be distressing. However, the causes of a
particular individual's difficulties are always complex. Our knowledge of what might have
contributed, and what might help, is always tentative. Professionals need to respect and work
with people's own ideas about what has contributed to their problems. They need to take into
account the person's background and culture, and consider whether their particular life
experiences and circumstances (for example poverty, trauma, racism, or homophobia) may have
contributed to their difficulties. Some people find it helpful to think of their problems as an illness
but others do not. Professionals should not promote any one view, or suggest that any one form
of help such as medication or psychological therapy is useful for everyone. Instead we need to
support people in whatever way they personally find most helpful, to ensure that the help offered
is culturally sensitive and accessible to everyone, and to acknowledge that some people will
receive support partly or wholly from outside the mental health system.

These ideas need to guide the whole service, not just the work of clinical psychologists or therapists
who work with, but slightly outside of, the main multi-disciplinary team. It is vital that teams
change their practice and base all care on a ‘team formulation’ which includes psychological and
social as well as biological aspects of the problem, and is developed in collaboration with the
service user.** This goes for all types of team: community mental health teams, conventional
outpatient clinics, residential or in-patient units including ‘psychiatric intensive care’, and forensic
services.

When people have severe problems or are in crisis and they or others might be at risk, we
sometimes have to make difficult decisions. In such situations it is tempting to rely on a simplistic
medical model: ‘this person has no insight into their illness so they need to be detained and
administered medication, by force if necessary: Of course we need to try to keep people safe.
However, in such cases it is all the more important that we try to understand the full complexity of
the person's situation, and bring it together in a comprehensive formulation so that we can offer
the most appropriate forms of help.

Understanding Psychosis 103


13.2 We need to replace paternalism with collaboration

Collaborative alliance

Clearly, any individual faced with living with serious mental health problems has some very hard
thinking to do, some difficult decisions to make and perhaps some risky experiments to try.
Anyone in such a situation might value an ally who could help them to work through the issues
involved and come to decisions that are right for them. Having decided on a course of action,
the person may well then require ... assistance that will enable them to carry through their
chosen course and help them to review their decisions from time to time in the light of events.

But that is not compliance, rather collaborative alliance.

Dr Rachel Perkins and Dr Julie Repper °

In the past services have been based on what might be called a ‘paternalistic’ approach - the idea
that professionals know best and that their job is to give advice. The ‘patient's’ role is to obey the
advice (‘compliance’). This now needs to change. Rather than giving advice, those of us who work
in services should think of ourselves as collaborators with the people we are trying to help. We can
provide general information about what can lead to problems, what can keep them going and
what can help - as indeed this report has done. However, each individual is unique and the only
way to find out what will help a particular person is to explore their particular situation with them,
and then support them to try things.

A trusting, collaborative relationship between the professional and the service user is a necessary
prerequisite of, and arguably as important as, any specific treatment. Any treatment (including
drug treatment) is unlikely to be very helpful on a long term basis unless the professional and the
service user have a positive and meaningfully collaborative relationship.° Although effective
relationships between staff and service users would seem to be an obvious necessity, services often
do not operate as if this were the case.

Every service user needs a worker who enables them to talk and think about their experiences in a
calm, supportive and non -judgemental atmosphere, and who is willing to accept - and if
necessary work within - their own beliefs about the nature of their experiences. This is perhaps the
most important message of this report.

13.2.1 Listening

An essential part of collaboration is listening. Professionals often underestimate the power of
simply listening. Careful listening is an essential prerequisite of offering appropriate help, and it is
also a powerful form of help in its own right. Many people say that lack of listening is what
disappoints them most about mental health services. This is even more the case for people from
minority backgrounds whose ideas about mental health may be very different from those of the
worker whom they are seeing and whose first language may not be English. It is important that
interpreters are available and that services train and employ staff who are familiar with different
cultures.

The importance of listening

Only once in 15 years of psychiatric intervention, and at the age of 36, was | able to find
someone who was willing to listen. This proved a turning point for me, and from this | was able
to break out of being a victim and start owning my experience. The nurse actually found time to
listen to my experiences and feelings. She always made me feel welcome, and would make
arrangements so that we would not be disturbed. She would switch off her bleeper and take her
phone off the hook, and sometimes, as there were people outside her room, she would close the
blinds. These actions made me feel at ease. She would sit to one side of me instead of across a
desk... Over a six-month period, | was able to develop a basic strategy for coping. The most
important thing that she did was that she was honest - honest in her motivations and in her
responses to what | told her... Thanks to the support this worker gave, | have been able to
develop a range of coping mechanisms.

During the five years | spent as a patient, | attempted on a couple of occasions to start talking
about the sexual abuse | experienced as a child. | desperately wanted to talk about it and | knew
it was necessary. But | was only discouraged from talking about such things. It was always
brushed off in the same way my MI5 theories were brushed off. ‘The problem with talking about
those things is that it will make your symptoms worse’ | was told by one therapist.

Sally Edwards

13.2.2 Accepting views other than the illness model

A second key aspect of collaboration is respect for people's beliefs about the nature of their
experiences. Some people view their difficulties as a medical illness, some see them as a reaction to
things that have happened in their life, some as spiritual experiences, and others as a combination
of these. Within Western mental health services, rejection of an illness view has sometimes been
seen as ‘lack of insight’, sometimes even as ‘part of the illness. However, it is unhelpful to insist
that people accept any one particular framework of understanding. In particular, professionals
should not insist that people agree with the view that experiences are symptoms of an underlying
illness. Some people will find this a useful way of thinking about their difficulties and others will not.

Understanding Psychosis 105


Someone who sees his problems as an illness

It was helpful for me to regard myself as having had an illness. This made me respectful of the
need to maintain and titrate medication ... the medication has helped me to make more, not less,
use of my psychological insight and thus genuinely to gain ground ... It has nonetheless to be
said that for this ... to be maintained over years, spiritual, psychosocial and cognitive-behavioural
methods were required - otherwise medication dosage would have needed to have been
extremely high.

Peter Chadwick ®

Someone who does not see his problems as an illness

My argument is that the psychiatric system, as currently established, does too little to help
people retain control of their lives through periods of emotional distress, and does far too much
to frustrate their subsequent efforts to regain self-control. To live 18 years with a diagnosed
illness is not incentive for a positive self-image. Illness is a one-way street, especially when the
experts toss the concept of cure out of the window and congratulate themselves on candour. The
idea of illness, of illness that can never go away, is not a dynamic, liberating force. Illness creates
victims. While we harbour thoughts of emotional distress as some kind of deadly plague, it is not
unrealistic to expect that many so-called victims will lead limited, powerless and unfulfilling
lives.

Peter Campbell °

Many people approach services unsure about how best to understand their difficulties. It is
important that professionals can reassure them that they are not alone in their experiences and
that help is available. However, it is also important not to ‘push’ one particular view about the
cause of experiences, whether this is a biological one (that experiences are something to do with
the working of the brain) or indeed a psychological one (that experiences are something to do with
the way we think). We need to remain open-minded, give people information (a copy of this report
perhaps) and support them in coming to their own understanding of their unique situation. Other
people who approach services - or in some cases receive them against their will - have already
arrived at a particular understanding of their difficulties and do not wish to discuss this. In such
cases, whilst providing information, we need to respect and work collaboratively with the person's
frame of reference. This is particularly important when working with people from different cultures
or minority backgrounds. It contrasts with the traditional approach which might have seen this as
‘colluding with delusions.

106 Division of Clinical Psychology


Working within the person's frame of reference/belief system

Even from the very first session | had with (clinical psychologist) | felt a huge sense of relief. My
‘symptoms’ became experiences again and rather than discouraging me to talk/engage/ entertain
them, he actively encouraged this. He wanted to get to know the voices | was hearing using
voice dialogue. Just a space to talk in detail about every quality of my voice hearing experience
to someone that wanted to listen was enough to shift things. Rather than telling me that the
beliefs | had were delusions that | should stop believing he asked all about my beliefs. He
focussed on how these beliefs made me feel and how | could live whole heartedly within these
beliefs. There was never a point were | was told what | experienced was wrong, illogical or
meaningless and there was CERTAINLY no agenda to get rid of my experiences, rather, the aim
was to get to know them...

Through writing | was able to begin sharing with (clinical psychologist) the sexual abuse |
experienced as a child and young adult. He helped me to understand what had happened and
understand and express how | felt about it. | had to begin to try and find myself not guilty and
give the shame | felt back to its rightful owner... the abusers. When | started to express the rage,
shame, fear and deep sadness | had bottled up, my voices began to calm down and give me an
easier time.

Last week at the ward round we decided to get someone a rape alarm. She believed that she was
being raped in the night on the ward. It's a women-only ward and the staff are really confident
no one is getting into her room. The staff think the beliefs are delusional. Nevertheless we are
getting her the rape alarm - working within her frame of reference and we anticipate this may
reduce her stress at night and help her recovery - it will also help if we can move her off the
acute ward!

Dr Sara Meddings, Clinical psychologist
Although your friends probably cannot hear or see what you can, it's possible for them to
understand and accept your reality and address it in a way which respects your experience.

location, my friend can pull it off me, even though he can't see it’
Anonymous "

My views and beliefs were wrongly interpreted as an illness. If the professionals concerned had

taken the trouble to consult with people from my own cultural background the facts would have
been perfectly clear to them. After release from hospital, under heavy medication, | was escorted
on an aircraft by a British doctor and returned to Nigeria, where | was not seen as ill but received

the spiritual help | needed and weaned off medication. | finally returned to the UK and now am a
practicing itinerant pastor/evangelist.

13.2.3 Collaboration rather than just ‘involvement’

Professionals must listen to what service users and former service users have to say about services and
treatments - it is only by listening that we can learn what really is helpful. It should be standard practice
or service users to be involved at all levels, from planning the service as a whole to providing feedback
to individual teams and, perhaps most importantly, in planning their own care.” Lived experience of
mental health problems should be recognised as an important source of knowledge alongside ‘book-
earning’ for professionals." As some NHS Trusts already do,"* services should see personal experience
of mental health problems as ‘desirable’ in their selection criteria for staff, including senior
clinicians. We also need to work with different communities - for example faith and cultural groups,
groups representing older people, people on low incomes or sexual minorities - to understand the
arriers they face in accessing help and ensuring that services are appropriate to their needs.

13.3 We need to stop telling people what to do and start supporting
them to choose

13.3.1 Trying things out

Professionals need to acknowledge that the only way someone can find out for sure what helps
them personally, is to try things out. Our role is to provide information about what is available and
what others have found helpful, and then support people to choose. Given the problems with
‘diagnoses’ outlined above, it is important that specific diagnoses (e.g. schizophrenia) are not
required in order to access services. We welcome the fact that guidance on how services should be
organised (into ‘clusters’ and ‘pathways’) takes this approach.'* However, we view with concern the
increasing emphasis on delivering set ‘packages of care’: workers need the flexibility to work with
each service user to meet his or her unique needs."®

13.3.2 Talking therapy

It remains scandalous that despite the NICE recommendations, still only a minority of people are
offered talking therapy.'” Psychological help should be available to all, as should help for family
members who support people experiencing psychosis. People should have a choice of therapists so
that they can find someone with whom they feel comfortable and who they feel understands the
issues they are facing. This is particularly important for people from disadvantaged minority groups
who often have difficulty accessing therapy,” or find that therapists do not have sufficient
awareness of their background or the particular issues they are likely to face.””'”? Wherever
possible people should be able to access services specifically for those who share their particular
background or experiences.**7°”°

13.3.3 Medication or no medication

Service users and their supporters have the right to information about the pros, cons, possible
adverse effects (‘side-effects’) and evidence base for any medication that is offered. Particularly
when contemplating taking medication long-term, people should be encouraged and supported to
ask questions about the drugs and any alternatives. Professionals need to be open about the fact
that prescribing is pragmatic: finding out whether medication is likely to help someone, and if so which
drug and dose, is always a trial-and-error process. We also need to provide information about the best
way to come off medication if that is what the person wants to do, and to support them in the process.

13.3.4 Professional help, peer support or self-help
As we explained above, many people will prefer community-based or self-help approaches to any

108 Division of Clinical Psychology


kind of professional treatment. Professionals need to give people information about groups affiliated
to organisations such as Mind, Bipolar UK, Rethink Mental Illness, Together, Intervoice, the Hearing
Voices Network and the Paranoia Network. Groups for people from particular communities are also
hugely important, especially given the poor deal that people from minority backgrounds often get
from mainstream services. Examples include the Chinese Mental Health Association (www.cmha.org.uk),
Sharing Voices””*”® (www.sharingvoices.net) which provides mental health support to diverse
minority communities in Bradford and Pink Therapy (www.pinktherapy.com) which offers services
to people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender.

13.4 We need to make rights and expectations explicit

As any treatment has the potential to do harm as well as good, the principle of informed consent is
paramount. People should have the right to refuse treatments, from ECT to medication and
psychological therapies.

Every service should publish a statement explicitly setting out what users can expect .”

The details of what is possible will vary from service to service, but the key thing is to make them
explicit. NICE has listed what people have a right to expect in UK mental health services.”

Example:
A public statement by a community service about what people who
use it can expect

Asa client you have the right to:

e eceive respectful treatment

e eceive treatment appropriate to your cultural background

e efuse treatment or a particular intervention strategy

e Ask questions at any time

e Know your worker's availability and waiting period

e Have full information about your worker's qualifications including registration, training
and experience

e Have full information about your worker's areas of specialisation and limitations

e Have full information about your worker's therapeutic orientation and any technique that
is routinely used

e Have full information about your diagnosis, if used

e Consult as many workers as you choose until you find one you are happy with

e Experience a safe setting free from physical, sexual or emotional abuse

e Agree to a written contract of treatment/care

e Talk about your treatment with anyone you choose, including another worker

e Choose your own lifestyle and have that choice respected by your worker/s

e Ask questions about your worker's values, background and attitudes that are relevant to
therapy and to be given respectful answers

e Request that your worker/s evaluate the progress of therapy/treatment

e Have full information about the limits of confidentiality

e Have full information about the extent of written or taped records of your
therapy/treatment and your right of access

. Terminate therapy/treatment at any time

. Disclose only that personal information that you choose

. Request a written report on therapy/treatment

Have access to any written summaries about your therapy/treatment.

13.5 We need to reduce the use of compulsion and mental health
legislation

13.5.1 Changing the culture of psychiatric hospitals

Mental health wards can be aversive places to be, particularly for anyone who does not think of
their difficulties as an illness. This is probably the main reason that mental health legislation has to
be invoked so frequently to keep people in hospital. Being admitted to hospital, especially against
one's will, is also often in itself a traumatic experience, inadvertently further traumatising people.”
We need to create places that people want to go to when they are in a crisis, that treat everyone
equally, and where care is informed by the approach outlined in this report. Acute wards need to
change so that they operate on the principles outlined here. Every district should also have at least
one non-medical crisis house.

There is a need to address institutional racism within services. The MacPherson Inquiry into the
murder of Stephen Lawrence” defined institutional racism as the ‘collective failure of an organisation
to provide an appropriate and professional service to people because of their colour, culture, or
ethnic origin...it can be seen or detected in processes, attitudes and behaviour which amount to
discrimination through unwitting prejudice, ignorance, thoughtlessness and racist stereotyping which
disadvantage minority ethnic people: These processes can happen even if people in the institution
do not individually hold racist beliefs or act in an overtly racist manner. A number of reports have
identified key changes needed in order to improve mental health services*** and recently there have
been calls for commissioners to play a more active role in rectifying ‘ethnic inequity.”

The inadequate care that many people with psychosis receive adds greatly to their distress...
Most have a period in a psychiatric hospital unit but too many of these wards have become
frightening places where the overwhelmed nurses are unable to provide basic care and support.
The pressure on staff for increased ‘throughput’ means that medication is prioritised at the
expense of the psychological interventions and social rehabilitation which are also necessary.
Furthermore, some wards are so anti-therapeutic that when people relapse and are in need of a
period of care and respite, they are unwilling to be admitted voluntarily; so compulsion rates rise.

Professor Sir Robin Murray, Chair of the Schizophrenia Commission *

13.5.2 Is mental health legislation inherently discriminatory? Is it used fairly?
Many psychologists feel that the existence of separate legislation which applies only to people
deemed ‘mentally ill’ is discriminatory, particularly in view of the problems we have outlined with
the whole idea of ‘mental illness: As mentioned above, there are also inequities in the way that the
law is applied, with those who already experience discrimination in society, such as homeless
people or people from BME backgrounds, also being more likely than others to experience
compulsion.

110 Division of Clinical Psychology


13.5.3 Is forced medication ever justified?

Some psychologists take the view that whilst compulsory detention can sometimes be justified in
order to keep someone safe, it is becoming increasingly hard to justify forced medication. The United
Nations Special Rapporteur on Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment has called
for a ban® on forced psychiatric treatment including drugging, ECT (electro-convulsive therapy),
psychosurgery, restraint and seclusion.

Coercion

| am ever ready to support consideration of alternative models of care where there is less
emphasis on coercive treatment. | still wake up from nightmares that | have been readmitted
and highly medicated against my will. In my community work | recognise the same fear in clients

who are desperate to not be misunderstood or judged hospitalisable. This fear of losing one's
freedom is a massive obstacle to collaborative mental health care. Where possible, therefore,
| believe it is important to not see sectioning and locked wards as given and fundamentally

necessary.
Rufus May *

13.6 We need to change the way we do research

Firstly, research efforts have been weighted too heavily towards the search for biological
abnormalities. The focus of research needs to turn much more towards the events and
circumstances of people's lives, and the way that these affect us at a social, psychological and even
biological level. We need to understand more about how different things can come together to
cause problems, particularly different types of disadvantage such as poverty, homelessness and
discrimination,**“' and about the links between inequality and mental health. We need to look
closely at services too, and in particular at the reasons that people from particular backgrounds
appear to get a bad deal” in terms of both diagnosis and help.°**°*°"”

he issue of funding for research is also important. Traditionally, drug companies have funded
much medical research into ‘schizophrenia’ This raises several important issues. Firstly, this research
has often been based on the assumption that the tendency to experience psychosis is primarily a
iological phenomenon. As this report has demonstrated, both this assumption and also the view
that everyone who has a diagnosis of schizophrenia needs to take medication, are increasingly
eing challenged. A second issue surrounding drug company funding is one of reliability and bias
of findings. Concerns that studies funded by drug companies selectively publish positive findings,
and do not publish negative results, have been supported by a number of studies.**“°*" The
rofound effects of the pharmaceutical industry's vested interests have been summarised in a
aper called Drug companies and schizophrenia: Unbridled capitalism meets madness.” There
remains an urgent need for more research funding that is independent of drug companies, and for
research which focuses on psychological, social and self-help approaches. People from different
communities need to be involved in designing and researching more inclusive forms of help.

Understanding Psychosis 111


13.7 We need to change how mental health professionals are trained
and supported
Perhaps even more important than the availability of specific talking treatments is the need for all
mental health workers to be aware of the information contained in this report. Many workers are
unaware of the psychological perspective on psychosis, and are unfamiliar with the research
described in this report. A fundamental message of this report is that ‘psychotic’ experiences are
understandable in the same ways as ‘normal’ experiences, and can be approached in the same
way.” This message needs to form the core of pre- and post-qualification training. A manual for a
two-day training course is available, Psychosis Revisited,* based on our earlier report and designed
to be delivered by a professional in collaboration with someone who has themselves experienced
psychosis. Training by people with personal experience is vital, both with regard to how people
understand their difficulties, and also with regard to what helps and what doesn't. The Health and
Care Professions Council has recently made service user involvement mandatory in professional
training courses.

We also need to ensure that training equips mental health professionals to work effectively in an
increasingly diverse society, and that the workforce is as representative as possible of the
communities it serves. Professionals need to understand the history of discrimination that some
eople have faced, including racism, sexism and homophobia, and how services can avoid making
things worse. Workers also need to learn about the very different ways that those of us from
different communities might think about mental health, and the importance of respecting those
erspectives rather than imposing their own view.°**°

Counsellors and therapists working in primary care or in secondary care psychological services
often lack training in working with people who experience psychosis - indeed, often such services
specifically exclude people who have experienced psychosis. This needs to change.

hese changes need not be expensive. We are suggesting a change in the way that all professionals
are trained and approach their work, rather than necessarily recruiting many additional staff.
raining costs money, but we are already paying for training, and it needs to change to reflect our
developing understanding of the nature of psychosis. What we are recommending is more
undamental than increased resources: a change in the guiding idea behind services.”

Finally, staff can only offer the compassion and emotional support that people need when they are
themselves supported and shown compassion by their organisation, and when the demands on
them are reasonable. It is vital that rather than being quick to criticise, we recognise how
demanding mental health work can be and also acknowledge its vital importance in our society.”

112 Division of Clinical Psychology


Section 14: What we all need to do differently

Key points

There is no ‘us and them’, people who are ‘normal’ and people who are different because they
are ‘mentally ill! We're all in this together and we need to take care of each other.

If we are serious about preventing distressing ‘psychosis’ we need to tackle deprivation, abuse
and inequality.

14.1 We need take on board that we're all in this together

— there is no ‘us’ and ‘them’
One of the most important messages of this report is that there is no dividing line between
‘psychosis’ and ‘normality: There is no ‘us' and ‘them’ - we're all in this together. Many of us hear
voices occasionally, or have fears or beliefs that those around us do not share. Given enough stress,
for any of us these experiences might shade into psychosis. Sometimes what constitutes ‘psychosis’
is in the eye of the beholder: for example, if someone does not get on with his or her neighbours, is
frightened of them and suspects their involvement when things go wrong, when does this shade
into ‘paranoia’? The main way that we all need to change is by taking on board that there is no ‘us’
and ‘them’, there are only people trying to make the best of our situation.

14.2 We need to focus on prevention

There's no point just mopping the floor and leaving the tap running.
Saying in public health circles '

We are working in a society that's creating distress as fast as we can mop it up.

Dr Lucy Johnstone *

This report has highlighted the complex causes of distressing psychotic experiences. What is
encouraging is that many of the causes are things that we can do something about. There is a
parallel here with public health in the physical arena, namely that some of the steps that need to
be taken are economic, social and even political. A famous example of the huge difference that
public health measures can make is that of Dr William Duncan in nineteenth century Liverpool. As
with most doctors in Victorian Britain, Duncan came from a privileged background. But after
working as a GP in a working-class area of Liverpool, he became interested in the links between
poverty and ill-health and started researching the living conditions of his patients. He was shocked
by the poverty he found, and in the clear link between housing conditions and the outbreak of
diseases such as cholera, smallpox and typhus. He started a lifelong campaign for improved living

Understanding Psychosis 113


conditions, particularly better housing, cleaner water and better drains, which led to huge
improvements in the health of many thousands of people. So what might be the mental health
equivalent of clean water and sanitation? The evidence suggests that two things are particularly
important: safety and equality. These are addressed in the following paragraphs, together with
other issues that we need to tackle in order to reduce the rates of mental health problems in our
society.

14.2.1 Prevention: safety
o feel safe and secure we need to know that our basic needs will be met. This is why efforts to
reduce poverty, and particularly child poverty, are so important if we are to reduce the numbers of
eople who go on to experience distressing psychosis.

0 feel safe and secure we also need to be able to trust those in positions of power over us. In
articular, when we are growing up we need to be able to trust the adults who are entrusted with

our care. This is why efforts to reduce child abuse and neglect are central to efforts at preventing
sychosis as well as other mental health problems. We all need to work with teachers, social
workers, community nurses, GPs and the police to identify and then respond to early warning signs
that children might be exposed to sexual, physical or emotional abuse, neglect or bullying. As
arents we need to seek support ourselves if we worry that our own stress is having an impact on
our children. Children who have been exposed to these things need support and nurturing and
there is evidence that where this happens, the likelihood of hearing distressing voices later in life,
or example, is much reduced.

14.2.2 Prevention: equality
Evidence shows that a major contribution to serious emotional distress is not only poverty but

articularly income inequality - the growing gap between the richest and poorest people in
society. In their book The Spirit Level, sociologists Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett demonstrate
that mental health problems are highest in those countries with the greatest gaps between rich
and poor, and lowest in countries with smaller differences.’ Equal societies are associated with
more trust and less paranoia. This suggests that rather than primarily targeting our efforts at
individuals, the most effective way to reduce rates of ‘psychosis’ might be to reduce inequality in
society.

14.2.3 Prevention: reducing discrimination and oppression

A classic paper published in 1994 was entitled Environmental failure - Oppression is the only
cause of psychopathology.’ Whilst some might think that goes too far, there is no doubt that
people who have been subject to oppression, and particularly discrimination (racism, homophobia,
discrimination on grounds of gender, disability or ‘mental health’) are put at risk by these
experiences, and that they can profoundly affect people's mental health. Some experts have argued
that they are therefore important public health issues as well as ones of social justice.°”*’ We can
all work to combat discrimination and promote a more tolerant and accepting society.

14.2.4 Prevention: reducing harmful drug use and addressing its causes

Alcohol is unquestionably the most serious substance-related public health issue, but cannabis and
other drugs have been associated with mental health problems in general and psychosis in
particular. Over-use of recreational drugs appears to make it more likely that someone will
experience a psychotic crisis. This does not necessarily mean that we need a stronger clamp-down
on drugs - the so-called ‘war on drugs' does not appear to have been won, and many people argue

114 Division of Clinical Psychology


that de-criminalising the possession and use of drugs would be an important positive step towards
protecting people's health. It is also important to address the social problems that lead people to
turn to taking drugs, including poverty, inequality, unemployment, hopelessness and feeling
disenfranchised from society.

14.2.5 Prevention: what we can each do to protect our mental health

So far, this section has concentrated on what we can do together to reduce the risk that some of
us will experience distressing ‘psychosis: However, research also suggests that there are things that
we can each do ourselves to protect our own mental health. Firstly, we can look after ourselves
physically: as we saw above, getting regular, good sleep is vitally important, as are nutritious food,
exercise, and exposure to open air and green spaces. We can exercise caution with recreational
drugs, even very commonplace drugs such as alcohol or cannabis. Since our social environment is
also vital, we can usefully examine our relationships with family, friends and colleagues and take
steps to resolve sources of stress. Money worries are one of the most common stressors. Although
our income is often beyond our control, we can take steps to deal with debt, to plan for retirement,
to manage our finances, and to plan for the future (psychologists call this ‘adaptive coping’).
Finally, we all experience major negative events during our lives, such as when someone close to us
dies. Whilst we can't prevent things happening, we have some control over how we respond. For
example, do we tend to jump to conclusions or take things personally? Sometimes it can help to
talk over with a friend or counsellor how and why we habitually respond the way we do, and any
changes we could make. The New Economics Foundation's ‘Five Ways to Wellbeing’ framework
might be of use here.

14.3 We need to campaign against prejudice and discrimination
on ‘mental health’ grounds

This report has shown how we can be affected as much by the reaction of people around us as by
the actual experiences themselves. For example, people who are seen as ‘mentally ill’ often
experience prejudice, rejection and social exclusion, which can be significant - sometimes even
insurmountable - obstacles to recovery. For many people, prejudice based on misinformation
presents a greater obstacle than the original mental health problems." Too many people have been
taken in by inaccurate media images and are prejudiced against those with mental health
difficulties, wrongly believing them to be incompetent, unreliable, unpredictable, and dangerous.

For many people, the mass media are their major source of information about mental health.
However, the way that problems are portrayed is often unhelpful. Unfortunately frightening stories
about unusual events have more ‘news value‘? A second reason is the lack of good information
available to journalists. In the absence of other sources of material, they currently often have to
rely on court cases and inquiries. Obviously this will lead to a preponderance of stories about crime
and tragedy. Alternative sources of material are badly needed, as is training for journalists.

We hope that this report will prove to be part of an ongoing major shift in public attitudes that
sees prejudice against people with mental health problems become as unacceptable as racism or
sexism.

‘In order to truly understand psychosis we must begin by listening to those who know this
rom the inside out: the voices and narrative of those who have been condemned as
“unanalysable" and mad. Far from being fantastical, the complex stories that are being
articulated communicate painful truths and the myriad ways in which the human psyche
survives overwhelming trauma:

Bentall, R. (2004). Madness explained: Psychosis and human nature. London: Penguin Books.
Richard Bentall argues that we need a radically new way of thinking about psychosis and its

‘In a Victorian-era German asylum, seamstress Agnes Richter painstakingly stitched a
mysterious autobiographical text into every inch of the jacket she created from her
institutional uniform. Despite every attempt to silence them, hundreds of other patients have
managed to get their stories out... A vast gulf exists between the way medicine explains
sychiatric illness and the experiences of those who suffer. Hornstein’s brilliant work helps us
to bridge that gulf, guiding us through the inner lives of those diagnosed with schizophrenia,
ipolar illness, depression, and paranoia and emerging with nothing less than a new model
‘or understanding so-called ‘mental illness’, one another and ourselves. One which asks not
‘what's wrong with you’ but ‘what happened to you and how did you manage to survive?’

Psychiatric diagnosis has become one of the most contested practices in mental health services.

Palgrave Macmillan.

Psychiatrist Joanna Moncrieff challenges the conventional view that antipsychotics are
specific treatments which target an underlying brain disease. She suggests that professionals
have often exaggerated the benefits of antipsychotics and minimised or ignored evidence of
their toxic effects, and that the pharmaceutical industry has been involved in expanding
their use into territory where it is likely that their dangers far outweigh their advantages.

Moncrieff, J. (2009). The myth of the chemical cure: A critique of psychiatric drug treatment.

London: Palgrave Macmillan.

This book examines research on antipsychotics, antidepressants, mood stabilisers and
stimulants. It suggests that psychiatric drugs work by creating altered mental states, which
suppress not only ‘symptoms’ but also other intellectual and emotional functions. Joanna
Moncrieff discusses the pros and cons of different sorts of drugs and suggests that
acknowledging the real nature of psychiatric drugs would lead to a more democratic practice
of psychiatry.

Macmillan.

This lively and provocative overview examines the lived experience of taking psychiatric

psychiatry? And why would a patient in Nigeria have a much greater chance of recovery than
one in the UK?

Kinderman, P. (2014). A prescription for psychiatry: A manifesto for a radical vision of mental
health and wellbeing. Basingstoke: Palgrave.
‘A prescription for psychiatry lays bare the flaws and failings of traditional mental health
care and offers a radical alternative. Exposing the old-fashioned biological “disease model” of
psychiatry as unscientific and unhelpful, it calls for a revolution in the way we plan and
deliver care. Kinderman challenges the way we think about mental health problems, arguing
that the origins of distress are largely social, and urges a change from a ‘disease model’ to a
“psychosocial model”. The book persuasively argues that we should significantly reduce our
use of psychiatric medication, and help should be tailored to each person's unique needs. This
is a manifesto for an entirely new approach to psychiatric care; one that truly offers care
rather than coercion, therapy rather than medication, and a return to the common sense
appreciation that distress is usually an understandable reaction to life's challenges:

Watters, E. (2011). Crazy like us. London: Robinson Publishing.
Ethan Watters suggests that over the last decades, mental illnesses popularised in America
have been spreading across the globe with the speed of contagious diseases. He travels
around the world and reaches the conclusion that the virus is the US - American culture
constantly shapes and sometimes creates the mental illnesses of our time. Watters suggests
that by setting aside its role as the world's therapist, the US may come to accept that it has
as much to learn from other cultures’ beliefs about the mind as it has to teach.

Whitaker, R. (2010). Mad in America: Bad science, bad medicine and the enduring mistreatment of
the mentally ill. New York: Basic Books.
‘Tracing over three centuries of “cures” for madness, Robert Whitaker suggests that medical
therapies - from “spinning” or “chilling” patients in colonial times to more modern methods
of electroshock, lobotomy, and drugs - have been used to silence patients and dull their
minds, deepening their suffering and impairing their hope of recovery: Whitaker presents
evidence that people diagnosed with schizophrenia in the United States fare worse than
those in poor countries, and possibly worse than asylum patients did in the early nineteenth
century. He argues that modern psychiatric drugs are just old medicine in new bottles and
that we as a society are deluded about their efficacy.

and support;

Professor Peter Kinderman for his extensive help and support with the editing process;

Dr Jayasree Kalathil and colleagues. Following the launch of this report, the editor Anne Cooke received an open letter
signed by Dr Kalathil, Professor Suman Fernando, Professor Philip Thomas and Dr Jan Wallcraft. It pointed out that the
report had engaged insufficiently with scholarship regarding the experiences of people from black and minority ethnic
communities in relation to psychosis and schizophrenia,' that people from these communities were not represented on

the author group, and that changes were needed to the language in some sections. Anne apologised for this and a
number of meetings took place to address these issues. This revised version published in 2017 includes amendments
addressing these issues and also the relationship between psychosis and social inequality more generally, drafted in
consultation with the signatories and with Professor Nimisha Patel. Other critiques of the report will be addressed in
future editions. This revised version of the original edition is dedicated to contributor Steve Onyett who sadly passed
away in 2015. His contribution to improving mental health care was immense. We miss you Steve;

¢ Dr David Harper and Professor David Pilgrim for their extensive contributions to the preparation of this revised version.
