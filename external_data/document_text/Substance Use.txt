FOREWORD BY RICHARD A. RAWSON, PHD


“A cutting-edge, comprehensive, and interactive approach to the science of addiction recov-
ery, written with great respect and compassion for the reader. Anyone struggling with the
demons of addiction will find real help here, and hope.”

—Terri Cheney, author of the New York Times bestseller Manic

“The Addiction Recovery Skills Workbook is an excellent translation of modern science into prac-
tical skills development. From explaining the basic brain changes associated with the devel-
opment of addiction to laying out a systematic path to behavioral change and recovery,
Glasner-Edwards has taken the very best of addiction science and turned it into common
sense and step-by-step instructions. I think this workbook will be as important for families
and friends of addicted individuals as for those affected directly. Either way, this is a power-
ful and practical tool to aid recovery.”

—A. Thomas McLellan, founder and chairman of the board of the Treatment
Research Institute, and former deputy director of the White House Office of
National Drug Control Policy

“In creating The Addiction Recovery Skills Workbook, Glasner-Edwards has developed a resource
that is at the cutting edge of recovery from addiction. In a respectful, direct, and clear way,
she provides readers with key tools necessary to build the motivation to change, learn the
skills needed to change, and apply those skills to achieving and maintaining change. Glasner-
Edwards does a wonderful job of integrating the three most critical innovations in evidence-
based approaches to treatment in the last fifty years: cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT),
motivational enhancement, and mindful observation. There has been excellent research in
all three areas demonstrating their value in aiding individuals in achieving their goals to be
clean and sober, and Glasner-Edwards has created a resource that will be a wonderful tool
for anyone addressing substance use problems. I anticipate this workbook will become a
standard in the field.”

California, San Francisco; associate chief of mental health for clinical administration
at the San Francisco VA Medical Center; and coauthor of Peaceful Mind

“As one of America’s most knowledgeable addiction scientists, Suzette Glasner-Edwards
writes with clarity and authority about the state of the art of treatment for addiction, a dev-
astating disease that affects millions of people and families. Glasner-Edwards explains the
complex science of addiction in terms that everyone can understand. Most important, she
provides guidance to help the afflicted overcome this illness. This book will help end the
stigma of addiction and it will save lives.”

—David Sheff, journalist and New York Times best-selling author of Clean
and the memoir Beautiful Boy


“In this self-care book, Glasner-Edwards provides a much-needed addition to the substance
abuse treatment field by providing a hopeful and highly accessible workbook for people
struggling with substance abuse and addiction. This book explains the mystery of addiction
and how to communicate with addiction treatment providers. It offers a range of interactive
evidence-based therapy tools and techniques to achieve self-directed behavioral change. It
integrates several important approaches, including cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT),
mindfulness, and motivational interviewing, giving individuals powerful tools to tackle this
devastating illness.”

—Karen Miotto, MD, clinical professor in the department of psychiatry and
biobehavioral sciences at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), and
director of the UCLA Addiction Medicine Clinic

“I have worked in clinical addictions research for over fifteen years, and I can honestly say
that this is no ordinary self-help workbook. Glasner-Edwards has expertly integrated the
powerful combination of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), motivational enhancement,
and mindfulness into an easily digestible treatment package that speaks directly to the
person with an addictive disorder. It does more than just present a how-to guide to the
implementation of these key, cutting-edge treatment strategies, however. This workbook also
contains clear advice as to how, when, and where to ask for help; provides a framework for
what is to be expected in the recovery process; and contextualizes the treatment strategies
with other traditional addictions programs (12-step, medication, etc.). These particular
inclusions mean that the workbook cuts across traditional, well-known barriers people report
when considering addictions treatment, such as the stigma and mystery about what might
happen, and problems with inconsistent, incoherent care. By integrating solutions that run
across a range of lifestyle factors (e.g., exercise, social network enhancement, communica-
tion) and common comorbidities (e.g., depression, anxiety), this workbook also stands to be
personally relevant to anybody concerned about their substance use, at any stage of severity.
By hitting all of these targets sensitively, respectfully, and comprehensively in this work-
book, Glasner-Edwards has provided a real service to the addictions community. I am going
to recommend this to all of my clinical colleagues!”

Foreword

remember in the 1980s being told by a seasoned counselor that “clients” should

not be educated about addiction, because it would allow them to feel like they

could understand and “control” their drug use and this would interfere with
their surrendering to their disease. For many years, addicted individuals in treatment
programs were repeatedly told that they should shut up and just do what they were
told. More recently, we hear celebrity endorsements for luxury treatment programs
and quasi-religions which suggest that if you simply pay lots of money to these orga-
nizations and follow their science fiction or their narcissistically-inspired formulas, it
is very possible to become “cured” and avoid the hard work of recovery. This is an
attractive and seductive message, but an inaccurate one—it creates false hopes, but
great profit margins. Both of these messages have been detrimental to the recovery
efforts of many people.

In the development of effective, evidence-based treatments for people with health
problems, including substance use disorders, a few fundamental principles have
emerged. First, it is important to educate individuals with scientifically accurate
information about their illnesses and about the steps they can take to improve their
health. Second, it is important to empower these individuals to take action and
become active participants in improving and maintaining their own health. Third, it
is critical that information is conveyed to these individuals in a respectful way, not by
talking down to them or being preachy or judgmental. Finally, to get people to use
treatment materials, those materials need to be relatable, interesting, and realistic. All
of these principles are important in giving people the tools they need to improve their
health and make positive changes in their lives.

The Addiction Recovery Workbook reflects a sophisticated knowledge of how to effec-
tively communicate to people struggling with substance use disorders. The workbook
has been developed with a keen awareness of the scientific literature on the nature of
addiction and the information and skills that are useful in helping people to stop



The Addiction Recovery Skills Workbook

using alcohol or drugs and develop a positive and sustainable recovery. The material
in the workbook is presented in a way that shows a true understanding of how con-
fusing, frightening, and discouraging addiction can be to individuals struggling with
excessive alcohol or drug use. The book communicates its message in a respectful
way, giving the readers credit for investing time and effort, for taking responsibility
for their own lives, and for seriously wanting to make changes, while at the same time
avoiding a condescending or paternalistic tone. In short, this book approaches readers
as adults who are responsible for their own lives—who recognize they want to improve
their lives, but are not sure exactly what to do or how to do it.

The reader is invited to join in the process of recovery, but, at the same time, it is
clearly acknowledged that there may be ambivalence about taking on this job of
recovery. Is this whole recovery thing really necessary? Do I really have a problem with drugs or
alcohol? Why does my intention to occasionally use slide into compulsive, sometimes catastrophic,
out-of-control, excessive use? Am I crazy? Do I have self-destructive tendencies? Am I a bad
person? I just want to be able to drink alcohol or use like a normal person—why does this go
“sideways” when I try? How can I tell if I am addicted? What does it mean to be addicted?

The first section of the workbook addresses many of the confusing and apparently
paradoxical elements of addiction and how good, intelligent people can be drawn into
a pattern of alcohol and drug use that can wreak havoc with their lives, resulting in
damage to themselves and the people they love. This section contains current, accu-
rate information about what addiction is, why some people get addicted and others
don’t, how to know if you do have a serious alcohol or drug problem, and what steps
can be taken to begin to address this problem. The clear message is that there are
many pathways and approaches to addressing problem alcohol and drug use. The
workbook helps the reader understand that many people may need treatment with
professional therapy, addiction medications, and 12-step support, and that the book
can be used together with these other recovery tools and approaches.

All of this information is given with a recognition that the reader is in a state o
ambivalence, which is natural and normal. Rarely do people dive into a program o!
recovery with a burning desire and deep commitment to changing their lives and
giving up a set of behaviors that, at one point in their lives, was a great source of
pleasure (and, at times, still is). As addiction is explained, many case examples and
conversations are used to illustrate the salient points and to show readers that the
workbook was written for people like themselves.

The heart of the workbook is a set of chapters that address the major aspects o:
the recovery process. Each chapter gives an overview of its main theme, using clear
explanations of the scientific principles and processes involved, as well as lots o

examples of how the issues it presents may relate to the reader's current situation.
And each chapter has a wonderful collection of worksheets and written exercises to
give readers a vehicle for expressing their own version of these issues and helping to
personalize the concepts. These chapters cover an amazing array of the most current
set of knowledge, principles, and skills that are considered either evidence based or
extremely promising and under active study.

Included in these chapters are concepts of self-directed behavior change; all kinds
of tools to help people modify thoughts and beliefs; ways to build rewards and posi-
tive new behaviors into a life in recovery; strategies for managing negative mood
states and coping with cravings for alcohol or drugs; relapse prevention approaches
and skills; and a format for creating a clear, simple, and practical recovery plan. The
approaches and strategies in these chapters come from well-established clinical
research literature. Included are concepts and skills from motivational interviewing,
cognitive behavioral therapy, community reinforcement therapy, relapse prevention,
contingency management, and the matrix model. In addition, other approaches are
included that are currently considered to hold great promise in the addiction field but
with more limited evidence. These include behavioral activation therapy, mindful-
ness meditation, dialectic behavioral therapy, and physical exercise.

Throughout the workbook, the principles and skills are illustrated with excellent
case examples and scripts of conversations that help bring the information to life and
make it useful. It is a very challenging task to communicate about the scientific litera-
ture on addiction and addiction treatment in a way that is accurate, understandable,
and engaging. These case examples are written in such a way that they illustrate chal-
lenges, concepts, and solutions in a very readable style. What could otherwise be a
litany of dry, clinical research is transformed into a collection of very relevant and
applicable skills that readers can use and apply to their own situations. The sample
conversation scripts help pull the readers into situations and allow them to vicari-
ously get a sense of how it feels to manage these commonly experienced recovery
scenarios.

The Addiction Recovery Workbook is an important new resource for individuals strug-
gling with alcohol and drug use problems. It is an active document, not a textbook to
be put on a shelf. The book has been written to enrich and empower the reader. For
people who struggle with repeated failures to self-manage their alcohol and drug use,
it is a refreshingly positive and hope-inducing resource. The overarching message is
that there has been a great deal of knowledge amassed about the problem of addic-
tion and there are many ways to make progress in achieving recovery. There is no one
school of thought that has all the answers, and there is no “right way” to recovery.


The Addiction Recovery Skills Workbook

The author clearly has great affection for the individuals she has worked with in
her clinical practice and her research, who struggle with addiction. Her commitment
to, and personal interest in, their well-being is conveyed on every page. The Addiction
Recovery Workbook is her way of giving a gift of hope and assistance to others who
struggle with alcohol and drug problems.

Introduction

magine that you are driving a car. Normally, your brain tells you when to go and
when to stop. If you see a green light quickly change to yellow as you approach
an intersection, your brain tells you, Hurry up, hit the brakes! There’s danger here!
and almost instantly, without thinking, your foot is thrusting downward. The light
turns red. You wait. The light turns green again. Your brain says, Okay, go! It’s safe now.
There’s a reason that your addiction is controlling you and your life, and not vice
versa. You may know when to go and when to stop when you're driving a car, but
research has shown very clearly that when you become addicted to alcohol or drugs,
the part of the brain that tells you when to stop drinking or using drugs becomes
impaired. It malfunctions—chronically. Terrible things can happen in your life as the
result of your alcohol or drug use, but your brain becomes stuck in go mode. The
brakes just stop working.
There are a range of circumstances that bring people into treatment for their
addictions or to seek out a source of self-help, like this book. Maybe you've gotten
into legal trouble; perhaps you've been arrested for driving under the influence. Yet
even in the face of these hardships, your addicted brain says, Go. Drinking will make you
feel better. Perhaps your alcohol or drug use has created conflict in one or more of your
important relationships, whether with parents, a partner, your children, or others
with whom you are close. Despite the hurt that your addiction has caused you and
your family, your addicted brain says, Go. Take a few pills; it will take the edge off They
just don’t get it. You can control it if you really want to.

ty

Maybe your school or work performance has suffered, or you’ve even lost your job
or dropped out of school or classes because of your alcohol or drug use. Your addicted
brain says, Go. You need to use to cope. If you don’t use, you'll fall apart. Another trigger
point for seeking help is when your use of alcohol or drugs creates or worsens another
condition. Maybe it used to make you feel better when you were depressed. But now



The Addiction Recovery Skills Workbook

drinking or using takes you to darker places than you ever could have imagined
before this whole vicious cycle started. Your addicted brain says, Go. Have a drink. You
need it.

There is a lot to learn about the addicted brain, and you will be an expert on your
own addiction once you've read this book. But first, take a moment to congratulate
yourself for overpowering the go response. If you're reading this book, that means
that something inside of you is telling you to fight your addicted neurobiology. You
had the intention to put on the brakes and find a way to reengage your brain’s ability
to say stop, and you acted on it. That intention usually comes from the recognition
that the pain and suffering that your addiction has caused you and your loved ones
now outweighs the good things that drinking or using once did for you.

As strong as that intention and recognition might be at this moment, the urge to
return to drinking or using can be equally, if not more, powerful. You already know
this, because you have tried to control your use before, but failed. Perhaps you have
even quit before, but somewhere along the way, the urge to drink or use took you over
and flipped the go switch back into place. It’s that constant battle between the addicted
part of the brain and the rational part of the brain that leaves those who suffer from
addiction vulnerable to repeated episodes of destructive alcohol and drug use. These

relapse episodes, while well understood as part of the illness, are often interpreted as
a sign that recovery is not really possible to achieve. Some addicts reject the experi-
ence of an urge itself, feeling that urges are a sign that something is wrong or that
they are not recovering.

Contrary to these ideas, scientific studies on the psychology of addiction have
established that urges to drink or use drugs can persist well into recovery, and are not
a sign of failure. As you learn more about the science behind addiction in this book,
and as you practice three of the most effective therapeutic techniques for promoting
recovery, you will develop an understanding of what an urge is and why it’s happen-
ing to you, and you will be better equipped to cope with it without drinking or using.

Research shows that urges will become less frequent and intense with time. But
even if they don’t go away completely, with the right skills under your belt, you can
manage them effectively over the long term. While you would ideally quit using
drugs and alcohol after a single try and never turn back, you have probably learned
through your own experience that managing urges to drink or use is not something
that you can learn overnight. That is why you need a range of skills and tools to
enable you to preserve your recovery anytime a situation, person, stressor, or state of
mind places your recovery in jeopardy.


Introduction

Who This Book Can Help

This book was written for anyone who suffers from alcohol or drug addiction. Addiction
is an illness that involves progressively losing control over your use. When you lose
control of alcohol or drug use, devastating things begin to happen as a result, but you
find yourself continuing to drink or use drugs anyway. Whether or not you have been
formally diagnosed with an addiction, if you feel that you have lost control over your
drug or alcohol use and you want to do something about it, this book can be helpful
to you. Specifically, the techniques you will learn from this book can help you to
strengthen your motivation to change your alcohol or drug use, and equip you with
the knowledge about addiction and a variety of coping skills that will enable you to
do so successfully. You will also learn about different types of treatment that are
effective for your addiction, so that if you decided to pursue formal treatment, you
will know what to look for and expect. This workbook focuses on alcohol and drug
addiction, which is in the category of substance addiction. Other behavioral addic-
tions, or compulsive behaviors that may require treatment (such as gambling), are not
addressed in this book.

If you are already working with a therapist or treatment provider for your addic-
tion, the exercises in this workbook can be a part of your therapy. Taking an active
role in your treatment by bringing in concepts you are learning through self-help can
be useful in many ways. First, it can help you focus your treatment on learning the
therapy skills that you find to be the most useful or that you need to work on the
most. Second, you can build confidence in your ability to master the techniques,
since you will be practicing them in these workbook exercises in between your therapy
sessions. Third, since we'll devote a lot of time to working on motivation, and scien-
tific studies have found that motivation predicts treatment success, you can improve
your own prognosis by engaging in exercises to strengthen your motivation.

This workbook is not in any way intended to be a replacement for formal psycho-
logical or psychiatric treatment for addiction or any related health condition, but it
can certainly be a tool for you to use while you are receiving treatment. Likewise,
health care providers who work with patients who suffer from addiction may find
this workbook helpful in suggesting exercises to increase motivation for change. It
can also be an effective way to introduce cognitive behavioral relapse prevention
skills, as well as mindfulness exercises for coping with uncomfortable emotions and
cravings for alcohol and drugs.



The Addiction Recovery Skills Workbook

Putting the Techniques into Practice

Thanks to the great scientific advances that have been made in addiction treatment
over the past decade, there is now a broader range of skills and treatment approaches
that can help you overcome your struggle with drug or alcohol addiction. Unlike
other addiction workbooks, which typically focus on a a single therapy approach
(such as cognitive behavioral therapy), this book features a range of research-based
techniques drawing on three distinct yet compatible behavioral therapies to enable
you to begin and sustain your recovery: (1) motivational therapy techniques, (2) cog-
nitive behavioral therapy, and (3) mindfulness techniques.

Motivational therapy techniques will help you get on the road to recovery, commit
to making changes to your drug or alcohol use, and, whenever you need to, revisit and
strengthen your motivation when it naturally shifts. The recovery process, like the
rest of life, has its ups and downs. Thus, it is entirely normal to have days when you
see perfectly clearly why abstaining from alcohol and drug use is essential to living
the life that you want, alternating with days when you question why you're going to
all of this trouble to live a life of recovery. Grappling with your ambivalence is a good
way to strengthen your motivation, especially when you have the therapeutic tools to
consider both sides of it in an intentional and systematic way. These are the tools that
you will learn about in chapter 3.

Cognitive behavioral therapy will help you understand how your thoughts (or
cognitions) can trigger addictive behaviors, and how to recognize and change the
“addictive thinking” that makes you vulnerable to relapse. And finally, mindfulness
techniques will help you to curb your impulses to drink or use when you are experi-
encing the discomfort of a craving or another emotion that you naturally want to “get
rid of.”

To help you practice and get comfortable using the techniques, in part 2 of this
workbook you will complete exercises that are easy, meaningful, and applicable to
your daily life. If you use this book to help you through the daily challenges you
encounter in your recovery, your experiences with the exercises will guide you to
discover which strategies help you the most. This way, by the time you finish the
book, you will have developed your own unique set of “go-to” skills. Not only will
these skills help you to steer clear of alcohol and drugs, but you can use them to help
you achieve life goals, strengthen your relationships, and live a healthier, happier
life.



Introduction

The Power of 12-Step Programs

You may be wondering how the techniques you will be learning in this book may or
may not be compatible with 12-step programs. The short answer is that they are com-
pletely compatible with the 12-step model and, in fact, attending Alcoholics
Anonymous (AA) or other self-help groups may even help you to exercise some of the
skills you will learn (such as reaching out for social support when you're feeling
tempted to drink or use drugs). Studies have shown that people who attend 12-step
groups and “work a program” by getting involved, finding a sponsor, working the
steps, and giving back—by speaking, making commitments to help out at meetings,
sponsoring others, or in other ways—tend to do well in their recovery in the longer
term (Morgenstern et al. 1997). That said, 12-step meetings are not the best fit for
everyone, and there are many people who recover successfully without being involved
in self-help meetings at all. In short, you can effectively acquire the skills in this book

without attending meetings, but if you are involved in a 12-step program, you will
find that what you learn in this book is compatible with the 12-step principles.

How to Use This Workbook

By now you probably have a good sense of some of the things you are going to learn
about as you read on. These are the main goals of working your way through the
chapters and exercises in this book:

¢ To understand how addiction has affected you psychologically and biologi-
cally, and what steps you need to take to enable your mind and body to
hea

¢ To abstain from using alcohol or drugs

¢ To learn strategies that enable you to “check in” with yourself regularly
about your motivation to change your addictive behaviors, and strengthen
your motivation when needed

¢ To learn healthy cognitive and behavioral coping skills

¢ To develop a mindfulness practice in your daily life, as a way of both coping
with your emotions and preventing you from giving in to urges to drink or
use drugs



The Addiction Recovery Skills Workbook

¢ To develop knowledge about the types of treatment (both psychological
and medical) that are available to you

That may look like a long list of goals, but they are all interrelated, and you can
achieve every one of them. It has happened for a lot of people—some of whom you
will learn about when their stories are presented in this book—who have gone from
feeling like their addiction was controlling and ruining their lives to achieving absti-
nence from alcohol and drugs and taking the control back. Regaining that control
opens up a whole new world of possibilities, and many recovering addicts use this
control as the core building block of a happy, meaningful life. This is not to say that
it will be easy. Although each person’s struggles are unique, all addicts struggle at
various points in their recovery.

This struggle is part of the hand you've been dealt in your life as someone vulner-
able to the disease of addiction. To overcome it successfully, you will undoubtedly
experience discomfort, frustration, vulnerability, tension, and—at times—even hope-
lessness. The key is to keep at it and never give up. Remember, it is not uncommon
for an addict to go through treatment multiple times before achieving success.
Likewise, many addicts relapse multiple times before they kick the habit for good.

If you work your way through this book, chapter by chapter; take the exercises
seriously (that means practice them as many times as you need to in order to feel
comfortable with each new technique); and make the commitment to work hard at it,
you will get the most you possibly can out of it. While it is suggested that you com-
plete the chapters in part 2 in order, you should not hesitate to come back to chapter
3 any time you feel that you need to revisit your motivation for recovery.

The therapeutic skills that you will learn in part 2 of this workbook can be used
alone or in combination. These techniques are designed to arm you with a range of
effective tools for managing your addiction, but you will not necessarily find each of
them to be equally helpful. That is okay! There is no “one-size-fits-all” approach to
treating addiction. You will get the most you can out of this workbook by trying

each step in order and evaluating which steps are the most helpful to you. If you
have a therapist who can talk with you about each of the skills as you progress
through the workbook, your therapist can help you to explore each concept as it

relates to your personal, unique set of addictive behavior patterns. However, it isn’t
necessary—this workbook can be helpful to you regardless of whether you are in
treatment. So let’s get on the road to your recovery and begin this healthy new
chapter of your life!


PART 1

Understanding
Addictive Behaviors




CHAPTER 1

How Addiction
Happens

hink back to the first time you realized that your control over your use of

alcohol or drugs was slipping away from you. Maybe someone said something

about it and you felt defensive (though you probably know by now, you felt
defensive because it was true!). Perhaps you recognized it yourself and tried harder to
moderate your use, but you kept on coming to the same conclusion: one drink, one
hit, one pill was no longer enough. One always led to more, and more led you to prob-
lems in your life. Yet even the problems weren't enough to give you the strength to
stop. The urge to continue, even if it made no sense, was too strong. This is what it is
to have an addiction. You lose control over your use of drugs or alcohol, wreaking
havoc on your life, and you find yourself continuing to drink or use anyway.

In this chapter, we'll go into greater depth about the signs and symptoms of
addiction, and you will learn about some of the things that might have made you
vulnerable to addiction. After completing the exercises that help you identify your
personal addiction risk factors and symptoms, should you decide that you need a
professional to evaluate you, this chapter provides guidance to help you identify a
qualified professional who can help.

How Is Addiction Diagnosed?

Though you can easily look in a textbook or on the Internet to find the criteria that
are used to determine whether someone has an addiction, you can probably define it


The Addiction Recovery Skills Workbook

just as well by reflecting on your own experience. What led you to believe that you
were in need of help to manage your use of alcohol or drugs, and what were the con-
sequences of your use in your life? As you are learning, addiction usually has to do
with a loss of control over drinking or using drugs. Let’s think about how that might
unfold. Consider what it was like when you started drinking or using. If you are like
most people, you started drinking for one of three reasons:

¢ Alcohol or drugs made you feel really good.

¢ They helped you to feel better when you were not feeling well (for example,
when you were in physical pain or discomfort, or when you were experienc-
ing negative emotions such as sadness, anxiety, or anger).

¢ They enhanced your performance at something (for example, sports or the
ability to work long hours without getting tired).

If you were seeking the good, pleasurable feelings, or the performance enhance-
ment, then your motivation was for what is known as positive reinforcement. If you were
trying to alleviate physical or emotional pain, then you were “self-medicating” with
alcohol or drugs. (This is also called negative reinforcement because you are drinking or
using to “take away” something unpleasant, like pain.)

Regardless of the reason you were drawn to alcohol or drugs, in the beginning, it
worked. You came to expect certain physical and emotional sensations when you
were drinking or using, and just like we come to expect pleasure from a tasty dessert
when we eat it (and the pleasure always comes!), you knew that you could count on
feeling the sensations you were expecting each time you drank alcohol or used drugs.
And this is what kept the pattern going: the more these expectations of elation, relax-
ation, happiness, confidence, relief, or any other sensation you were seeking were
fulfilled, the more you wanted to drink or use drugs.

At some point, a transition occurred. The usual sequence of drink or use, and feel
good or better did not work in the same way that it did initially. Maybe you developed
tolerance. This happens when the amount of alcohol or drug that first gave you the
feeling you were seeking no longer works in the same way; you begin to need more.
Maybe you started to experience withdrawal symptoms, which are the unpleasant effects

of alcohol or drugs leaving your body. These symptoms can lead you to want to drink
or use more so that you will feel better. Though these effects are different depending
on which drug you use, they usually involve a combination of unpleasant physical
sensations (such as nausea or vomiting, headaches, shaking, and sweating) and
emotions (such as depression and anxiety). When the symptoms of tolerance or

10


How Addiction Happens

withdrawal begin, this often marks the progression of what started as social or recre-
ational alcohol or drug use to problematic use. As this transition occurs, you start to
feel that you need to drink or use just to feel normal.

So, how do you know when you're addicted? It’s when that need—to drink or use
to feel normal—starts to override most of the other things you value in life. During
that process, people and things that are important in your life become affected by
what has now turned into compulsive drug or alcohol use. This happens because, when
you are so preoccupied with drinking or using to feel “okay,” other things you used
to do with the time that you spend using, recovering from using, and planning to use
again start to fall by the wayside. What’s more, despite its negative impact on one or
more aspects of your life (such as your ability to be productive, your physical and
emotional well-being, and your important relationships), you find yourself continuing
to drink or use anyway. In the 12-step philosophy this is often referred to as the
“insanity” of addiction; you keep on doing the same thing over and over again (drink-
ing or using), yet you are expecting different results. You think, It’s not going to get out
of hand this time! when, in reality, your days of drinking or using in moderation are far
behind you.

Let’s take a look at how this pattern developed in Charlie’s life.

Charlie’s Story

Charlie is a twenty-three-year-old man who is attending a local university as a
Computer Science major. He experimented with drugs and alcohol throughout his
teens, with phases of smoking pot daily alternating with phases of heavy drinking.
But pot and alcohol were easy for him to give up and he never considered himself to
be a person with “addictive tendencies.”

When he was in his second year of college, a friend of his offered to share some
pills he was taking to enhance his ability to pay attention and stay up for long
hours during final exams. The pills, called Adderall, were prescribed to his friend
for attention deficit disorder, but his friend took a little more than he was
prescribed and found that it helped him when he needed to cram for exams or big
assignments. Charlie thought, Why not? and after trying the Adderall a few times,
he found that it really enhanced his performance in school during finals. So he
started asking around and found someone to supply him, just in case he wanted to
get it in a crunch.

11


The Addiction Recovery Skills Workbook

After a few months of using Adderall on and off, Charlie found himself using the
pills not only for finals or major assignments, but habitually for studying or
homework. Adderall became somewhat of a crutch for focusing his attention. Despite
the benefits, Charlie, who was normally a very upbeat and sociable person, found
himself feeling irritable, preferring to be alone much of the time. When he wanted to
sleep after studying for long hours on Adderall, he just couldn't bring his energy level

down and he found himself struggling wit
cut back on the Adderall several times, eac!

terrible insomnia. Though he tried to
time he found that his concentration

was poor, and he felt stressed about the impact this could have on his grades.

In an attempt to resolve his insomnia p:
for some sleeping pills, but they didn’t worl

roblem, Charlie acquired a prescription
k. He found himself doubling and

sometimes tripling the dose to get to sleep.
between the sleeping pills and the Adderal
think clearly. As a consequence, he was less productive at school. Charlie was
becoming more and more isolated from his friends, and his grades started to slip.
His life suddenly seemed to be dominated by pills: thinking about them, coming
down from them, feeling the urge to take them, and planning how he was going to
manage the balance between the uppers (Adderall) and the downers (sleeping pills)
so that he could get everything done. Though he was trying his best to keep it all
together, his life was slowly coming apart.

Though Charlie was working a part-time job at the campus bookstore, the cost
of taking Adderall regularly began to add up and he started running out of money.
As his supply of Adderall ran out, he felt depressed, irritable, unmotivated, and
unable to concentrate. His parents came to visit him at school just prior to spring
break, and without a thought, he took his mother’s checkbook out of her purse and
wrote himself several checks of a few hundred dollars each to cash. Maybe, he
thought, if the amounts were not so large and he cashed them gradually, she
wouldn't notice.

After only a few weeks of alternating
, Charlie felt overtired and unable to

out of character for you when drugs or alcohol have taken hold of you and your life.
What started out as using to feel good or to alleviate some negative feelings (or if
you're like Charlie, to enhance your performance in some way) somehow got very out
of hand. Much of this has to do with the effects of substances on the brain, which are
explained in the next chapter. But first, let’s spend a few minutes looking over the
signs and symptoms of addiction.

arlie, you have probably found yourself acting in ways that are completely

How Addiction Happens

Exercise 1.1: Addiction Signs and Symptoms

Below is a list of signs and symptoms of addiction. Place a check next to those that you have

experienced in the past twelve months.

Tolerance

You need to use more alcohol or drugs to feel the desired effect.

The same amount of alcohol or drugs doesn’t do what it used to.

Withdrawal

Craving

When you don’t have alcohol or drugs, you are uncomfortable physically or
emotionally.

You've used alcohol or another substance to help make yourself feel better
when you were coming down from alcohol or drugs.

You think about drugs or alcohol frequently.

Until you've acted on an urge by drinking or using, it is very hard to get it out
of your head.

Loss of Control

You've made rules for yourself concerning how much you will drink or use but
you were unable to stick to them.

You've tried to quit or cut back your use of alcohol or drugs but were not able
to.

You've found yourself drinking or using more than you had planned to or for
a longer period of time than you meant to.

You've felt at times that you couldn’t fit in or feel good without alcohol or
drugs.

13


The Addiction Recovery Skills Workbook

You have used alcohol or drugs when you were feeling upset or angry with
someone.

You have blacked out (or had periods of time for which you have no memory)
when under the influence of alcohol or drugs.

You have overdosed on drugs.

You have used one or more drugs without knowing what it was or how it would
affect you.

The thought of running out of drugs or alcohol makes you anxious.

Legal Problems

You have been arrested or had other legal problems as a result of drinking or
using.

You have stolen things to pay for alcohol or drugs.

Problems in Social or Occupational Functioning

You have made mistakes at work or school because of your use of drugs or
alcohol.

Your use of alcohol or drugs has hurt your relationships with others.

You have not been able to fulfill important role obligations (such as household
chores, financial responsibilities, or caring for children or other loved ones) as
a result of drinking or using.

You have lost interest in hobbies or things you used to enjoy (such as spend-
ing time with friends or family) while increasing the time you spend drinking or
using.

Persistent Use Despite Negative Consequences

14

Despite your awareness of one or more negative effects of alcohol or drugs
on some aspect of your life or ability to function, you find yourself continuing
to drink or use drugs anyway.


How Addiction Happens

Impairment or Distress Resulting from Use

You have not taken good care of yourself (for example, not eating well or not
practicing good hygiene) because of your alcohol or drug use.

Drinking or using drugs has caused or worsened existing psychological or
medical problems (such as depression, anxiety, or cardiovascular disease).

If you marked any of the signs and symptoms that go beyond tolerance and with-
drawal, you have, at a minimum, experienced alcohol- or drug-related problems. Some
people experience such problems without actually being addicted, and they decide to
quit or cut back on drinking or using. These are very healthy choices, because having
had the experiences described on the checklist suggests that you may be at risk for
greater problems (including addiction) if you continue to drink or use. In the Resources
section you will find resources for learning about controlled drinking or harm reduction
approaches to the use of alcohol or drugs. The goal of harm reduction is to reduce,
but not quit, drinking or using. It is important for you to know, however, that this
workbook is written for those who suffer from addiction and are open to an abstinence-
based program of recovery.

This exercise is not intended to substitute for a formal diagnosis of addiction. It
will, however, help you to reflect on the way your use of alcohol and drugs has
affected your life. If you have not been evaluated professionally, your responses may
provide some indication of whether it would be a good idea to find out more about
the seriousness of your problem and consider treatment that extends beyond
self-help.

If you think that you may have an addiction, but you are not sure, then you
should be evaluated by a professional right away. Ideally you should seek out a profes-
sional with expertise in addiction. Appropriate professionals may include medical
doctors, psychologists, counselors or therapists (with a master’s degree in either psy-
chology or social work), or admissions counselors at addiction treatment facilities.

How and Where to Seek Professional Help

Finding the appropriate professional to conduct a careful evaluation of your addic-
tion symptoms is not always easy, especially if this is a new problem or if you have
never seen a professional to help you with mental or emotional problems. If you have
seen a mental or behavioral health professional in the past or are currently working

15


The Addiction Recovery Skills Workbook

with someone whom you trust, even if that person has not helped you previously
with problems related to your alcohol or drug use, it is a good idea to share your con-
cerns with that person, and ask them (1) if they have training and experience that
will enable them to assess or treat you for this type of problem, and (2) if not, whether
they can recommend an addiction expert whom you can see for an evaluation. If you
don’t have a mental health professional to work with but you have a primary care
doctor with whom you feel comfortable, you can request a referral to an addiction
specialist from your doctor. It is always an advantage if you can get a referral from a
trusted medical professional to someone else with whom they have worked. That way,
the referring professional has a good sense of the quality of the person or program to
which you're being referred.

Sometimes people feel hesitant to talk with their doctor or counselor about alcohol
or drug use because they are worried that the information will be shared with a
family member or someone else. Remember that there are very strict privacy laws
that prevent doctors and other professionals from sharing anything you tell them
about your alcohol or drug use with anyone else without your explicit permission
(unless you share information that indicates that you may seriously harm yourself or
another person).

When you talk with a doctor or other professional for the first time about your
concern that you might have a drug- or alcohol-related problem, there are three key
elements you can introduce to the conversation to help make it go smoothly and
minimize your discomfort:

1. Let the person know how hard it is for you to talk about this. This will set the tone
for the conversation and engage the person’s feelings of empathy toward
you.

2. Describe your concerns succinctly and straight to the point, without going into detail
until the person asks questions. This will help you to get your point across
clearly, and then, as you get a sense of the other person’s reaction and your
comfort level with the conversation, you can decide how much detail you
are comfortable sharing.

3. Make a direct request for what you hope to get out of the conversation. If you are
seeking a referral, ask for it directly. If you are concerned about your privacy
and confidentiality concerning what you are revealing, express that directly
and ask that the information be kept confidential.

How Addiction Happens

Finding the Words

Let’s take a look at how Charlie expressed the need for professional help, using the
three key conversation elements described above. Even though Charlie felt that he
couldn't help himself when he stole the checks from his mother, he struggled with
intense guilt and shame afterward, and he began to recognize that he was losing
control over his behaviors surrounding his use of Adderall. Even though part of him
didn’t want to give up Adderall, perhaps a greater part of him realized that he was
acting in ways that were concerning and that he needed professional help.

Charlie had a pediatrician whom he really felt he could trust. His pediatrician
treated him for general health issues all the way up until he went away to college,
and even though he felt self-conscious about approaching him to talk about the
problems he was having with Adderall, he didn’t feel ready to talk with his parents
about it. He knew, however, that it was only a matter of time before his mom would
notice the checks he had stolen from her and that, sooner or later, the truth would
come out. Charlie realized that if he needed to tell his mom about his drug
problems, he would be better off doing that with the advice of a professional. So he
called his pediatrician, Dr. Amira.

Charlie: Hi, Dr. Amira. Thank you for taking the time to talk with me.
Dr. Amira: You're welcome, Charlie. What’s going on?

Charlie: Well, this is very difficult for me to talk about because I feel worried
for myself and, at the same time, very ashamed about this problem that
I am having. So please bear with me.

Dr. Amira: | Okay.

Charlie: Before I tell you about the problems I’ve been having, I need to ask you
about the confidentiality of the things that I tell you. Are you able to
talk with me about some issues I’m having without sharing what I say
with my family?

Dr. Amira: Yes, Charlie. Everything you say to me is completely confidential,
unless you tell me something concerning about your safety or the
safety of someone else, such as expressing an intention to harm
yourself or another person. Or if you tell me about someone who is
being abused—under those circumstances I would need to report what

17


The Addiction Recovery Skills Workbook

you tell me to protect you or someone else who is in danger. But
anything else that you say to me will stay between us.

Charlie: Thank you. It helps to know that. The reason I called is because you
are the only person I trust to tell about what has been going on with
me. I started using Adderall to stay up and study for finals, and I’m
concerned that I may have become addicted to it.

Dr. Amira: Yes, Adderall can be highly addictive. Let me be sure I understand you,
though. Did anyone prescribe it to you, or were you getting it some
other way?

Charlie: (pausing, a little bit hesitant and embarrassed) Well, I feel bad admitting
this, but I got it from a friend at first. Nobody is prescribing it to me.
The reason I was calling is because I think I need a professional to
evaluate me and help steer me in the right direction, and I was hoping
that you might know of an addiction specialist in the New York City
area whom you could recommend.

The three key elements in the sample dialogue—all of which emphasize direct-
ness and encourage empathy—can help you not only when you are asking a profes-
sional for a referral, but also when you’re communicating with friends and family
about your participation in addiction treatment. We will come back to communica-
tion skills and rehearse them later, in chapter 4.

Returning to the issue of finding a competent professional to evaluate you, if you
don’t have a doctor or other treatment provider whom you can ask for a referral, you
have a few other options. First, if you’d like to speak with a doctor who has specialized
training in addiction, there are a number of professional organizations you can go
through. See the Resources chapter at the end of this workbook for some examples.

Apart from individual providers such as physicians or therapists, addiction treat-
ment programs are staffed with various qualified professionals who can evaluate your
symptoms. It may be reassuring to remind yourself that making an appointment for
an evaluation doesn’t mean that you are committing to entering treatment. The
Resources section at the end of this workbook contains some links to useful search
engines for treatment programs.

Browsing the options on these websites, while very informative, can also be over-
whelming if you don’t know what you're looking for. There are certain questions that

18


How Addiction Happens

you will want to ask when you're looking for a treatment program, to get a sense of
the quality of the program and whether it can meet your individual needs. Some
examples of key questions to ask, and the responses you'd look for in a quality

program, are provided in the following table.

Questions to Ask When Seeking Treatment

Question

Desired Responses

Is the treatment approach
you use supported by
scientific studies?

Behavioral therapies and medications are the most
well studied approaches. A combination of the two
is ideal.

Can you describe the
types of behavioral
therapies you use in
your program?

The behavioral therapies with the most scientific
support include cognitive behavioral therapy,
motivational interviewing, and motivational
incentives.

Do you provide medicines
to treat addiction
symptoms directly?

Medications can be prescribed to help a person to
stop abusing alcohol or drugs, or to prevent relapse.
Whether they are prescribed will depend on the
program. Examples of medications a treatment
provider might mention are naltrexone, vivitrol (an
injectable form of naltrexone), acamprosate,
methadone, or suboxone (also known as
uprenorphine).

What range of services
do you offer to tailor the
plan of treatment to my
individual needs?

In addition to drug abuse treatment, ideally the
program will provide other services to address your
unique individual needs. These may include
psychiatric assessment and treatment for other
conditions (such as depression or anxiety), medical
treatment (including medical detoxification from
drugs or alcohol if needed), family therapy,
vocational programs to assist with returning to
work or seeking employment after treatment is
complete, self-help groups, and social services.

19



The Addiction Recovery Skills Workbook

What type of continuing
care is provided after I
finish the treatment
program?

Since ongoing management of your addiction is
crucial for treatment success, many programs offer a
continuing care or aftercare therapy group in which
you can continue to receive support after you have
“graduated” from the program. Inquire about
therapy or supportive groups you can participate in
once you've completed treatment. If none are
provided, then you'll want to discuss how ongoing
care plans will be developed for longer-term
management of your addiction after you finish
treatment.

Is drug or alcohol use
monitoring included in
the program?

To be sure that your individual needs are being
met, ongoing drug testing should be part of your
care, so that if you relapse during treatment, your
treatment plan can be adjusted accordingly to
maximize your chances of treatment success. A
healthy treatment philosophy is that relapse does
not indicate failure; it means that the treatment
plan needs to be revisited and individualized to
address the specific problems that are being
encountered.

How long is treatment?

Research studies show that at least three months of

treatment is usually needed to effectively help you
to stop using alcohol or drugs and maintain your
treatment benefits. Studies generally show that the

longer a person stays in some form of treatment,
the better.

Is 12-step self-help part
of the program?

The social support from 12-step groups can be
helpful both during and after treatment has ended.
Ideally, getting you engaged in a 12-step program
will be part of your treatment.

20



How Addiction Happens

What Makes You Vulnerable

Why me? you might find yourself asking. Why is it that some people can take or
leave alcohol or drugs, experiment with them (even heavily), and then just turn the
page as though it never happened? You can probably think of at least a handful of
people like this whom you’ve known or even used to drink or use with. Now they just
drink or smoke pot here and there, socially. Maybe they even get a little too drunk
or high from time to time, but for the most part, they keep it under control.

Why can't I do that? you may wonder. Many people who seek out help for their
alcohol or drug use find themselves, at some point in the process, wishing they could
be that person who could take it or leave it. You might find yourself fantasizing about
drinking or using socially at some point, and it is normal to want to be able to do
that. The loss of control over drinking or using drugs that you've experienced is not
normal, and addressing that effectively might mean giving up your “ideal” of drink-
ing or using in moderation, at least for now. It doesn’t mean that for everybody, but
clearly the least risky path to long-term recovery from addiction is to quit using alto-
gether. Coming to terms with the reality of that can be very hard.

Although there is no single reason that can explain why you are more vulnerable
than some of your friends or family members, studies have shown that there are
common risk factors that increase the likelihood that a person will develop an addic-
tion. The worksheet below will help you to identify some of your personal risk factors.

Exercise 1.2: Personal Risk Factors

Below you will find a list of biological, environmental, and other conditions that increase the
risk for addiction. Place a check mark beside those conditions that you have experienced.

You have at least one family member who suffers from addiction.

You have had depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, or other psy-
chological problems.

Your parents or other role models used alcohol or drugs excessively around
you when you were growing up.

21


The Addiction Recovery Skills Workbook

Your parents or other role models engaged in criminal behavior consistently
when you were growing up.

You had friends and acquaintances at school who were using drugs and
alcohol when you were in your teens.

You had trouble in school as a child (for example, a learning disability or poor
grades).

You had difficulty making or keeping friends or feeling like you “fit in” with your
peers when you were growing up.

There was a lot of chaos and conflict at home when you were growing up (for
example, lots of fighting between the adults in your home).

You were physically or sexually abused.

You started experimenting with alcohol or drugs as a child or in your early teen
years.

You have smoked or injected drugs.

You had some traumatic experiences in your life prior to starting to use alcohol
or drugs excessively.

The more risk factors you have, the more vulnerable you are, so if you have lots of
check marks above, it will help you to make sense of why you've been affected by
addiction. But even if you didn’t check off anything on the list, or if you checked off
only one or two risk factors, you can still develop drug or alcohol addiction.

How could that be? you might wonder. For starters, it is important to remember that
these risk factors do not each have an equal influence on whether or not you become
addicted. For example, genetic factors (such as whether or not you have an immediate
family member with addiction) explain between 40 and 60 percent of a person’s vul-
nerability to addiction (Kendler et al. 2000; Tsuang et al. 1998; Tsuang, Stone, &
Faraone 2001). Although many people with family members who suffer from addic-
tion do not themselves become addicted, among those who do develop an addiction,
the genetic vulnerability is usually paired with conditions in the environment that
“activate” problem drinking or drug use (Enoch 2012).

For example, when a person who is genetically vulnerable grows up in a chaotic
home environment, where he or she is abused and witnesses a parent or role model

22


How Addiction Happens

abusing alcohol or drugs, these conditions can “activate” the genetic tendency to
drink or use drugs excessively. Even with a perfectly healthy home environment, a
person who suffers from depression or anxiety and is exposed to a peer group that is
using drugs or alcohol would be more likely to develop an addiction than a person
who experienced either one of these conditions alone.

Wrap-up

In this chapter, you've learned some important things about yourself. You explored
some of the unique aspects of your history, family, and life experiences that placed
you at risk for addiction. You also identified your symptoms of addiction. You can
reflect on this list any time you need to strengthen or remind yourself of your motiva-
tion to keep on actively working on your recovery.

If you aren't in treatment already, you now have some guidance about how to ask
health care professionals whom you know and trust to help you identify one or more
treatment providers with specialty training in addiction. You can also access some
helpful resources at the end of this workbook to enable you to do some research on
treatment on your own, and you are armed with good questions that will help you to
find the treatment program that is the best fit for you. In the next chapter, you will
deepen your understanding of the way addiction has affected you biologically and
how some of the effects of these substances on the brain can explain your loss of
control over alcohol and drugs.

23




CHAPTER 2

Addiction Is a

Brain Disease

t the beginning of this book, you read about how the brain’s ability to “put
on the brakes” and control impulses malfunctions when you become addicted
to something. As a result, you get stuck in go mode even when giving in to
your impulses can be harmful to you. In this chapter, you will learn more about how
excessive alcohol and drug use alters the brain, and how science-based medication and
psychological treatments for addiction can help the brain heal in recovery. You will
also become familiarized with some of the medications that are available to promote
this healing process.
As you hopefully have started to process by now, you have a disease, and it is
serious. The bad news is that this disease can be very destructive and not only ruins
but also takes lives every single day. The good news is that it is very treatable. People
can and do get better, and you can be one of them. In this workbook, you are going
to learn the most effective behavioral therapy techniques that are used in addiction
treatment. By practicing the combination of these strategies that are uniquely helpful
to you personally, you can increase your chances of getting better. Let’s take a look at
how addiction affects the brain, and what you can do to help yourself heal.

The Mind on Drugs Is Not Rational

Though the stigma that follows the illness of addiction is far from gone, advances in
medicine and science have deepened society’s understanding of addiction as a chronic

disease. As the word has spread about this in the popular media, and more celebrity
faces have either come forward or tragically lost their lives to addiction, the growing
curiosity about addiction has provided an opportunity to educate the public about
the seriousness of the illness.

In this process, addiction experts in the media have at least partially debunked
some of the myths about addiction being a “moral failing” or a “choice.” Even though
the initial decision to drink or use drugs is made by voluntary choice, research has
shown that as alcohol or drug use progresses to addiction, the ability to make rational
choices becomes affected (NIDA 2010). Because the ability to choose rationally is
what enables us to choose healthy behaviors, take care of ourselves, and act as moral
and ethical human beings, the impact of excessive drug use on the brain can be dan-
gerous and disabling. As drug use becomes compulsive, the “choice” to use is not
made in the rational way that we make most other choices in life.

Most of the choices we make involve weighing the pros and cons of doing one
thing versus another. For example, let’s take a look at the thought process of someone
who has never been addicted to alcohol or drugs. Jody gets invited to a party by
some friends from work. The party happens to be the day before she has an impor-
tant meeting that she will need to prepare for. She goes to the party and her friends
are drinking and smoking pot. In deciding whether or not she is going to drink and
smoke, a lot of thoughts go through her mind—thoughts such as Jf I smoke and drink
with my friends, this is going to be a lot more fun, and I don’t want to come across like a party
pooper. As she tries to figure out a solution, she has thoughts such as Maybe I can party
with my friends on another night, and If I don’t perform well at the meeting, how will that
affect me?

Though the decision-making process may appear simple, the thoughts that run
through Jody’s mind reflect a complex process of reasoning and judgment that enable
her to plan what to do next. Maybe the plan will be to stay a short time at the party
so that she will not be overly tempted. Maybe the plan will be to have just one drink
and skip smoking pot this time. This is the process that a “rational brain” goes through
to arrive at a decision. Whether or not the decision turns out to be the best one, it
comes at the end of a rational thought process.

When you are addicted to something, that rational process becomes impaired;
your actions in relation to using drugs and alcohol become dominated by your
impulses, while the part of your brain that controls reasoning, judgment, and weigh-
ing pros and cons malfunctions. Here’s why:

26


Addiction Is a Brain Disease

How Drugs Act in the Brain

From the time we're born, our brains are wired to reward pleasurable experiences.
For example, when we eat something that tastes delicious or when we hear music that
we enjoy, our brain’s reward system releases brain chemicals that produce feelings of
pleasure. These brain chemicals (also known as neurotransmitters) are part of the
brain’s communication system. The nerve cells in your brain release these chemicals,
which act as “messengers.” They carry messages between nerve cells. When you eat
something delicious, a nerve cell releases a neurotransmitter called dopamine. This
nerve cell is the one that is “sending” the message. The message has to be received for
you to experience pleasure. What happens next is the dopamine attaches to another
“receiving” nerve cell. Once the message has been received, any “extra” dopamine
that remains in the space between the two cells (known as the synapse) is recycled or
brought back into the “sending” nerve cell.

What do you feel when all of these messages are going back and forth in the
nerve cells in your brain? When it involves the release of dopamine, the brain’s
natural pleasure chemical, you feel great, and you want to repeat the behavior.
Alcohol and most drugs that people become addicted to interfere with the brain’s
communication system. Their chemical structure is so similar to some of our natural
brain chemicals, like dopamine, that they can convey a “false” message to a nerve
cell, causing it to release unusually large amounts of dopamine. They can also prevent
extra dopamine from being recycled, so that it continues to send messages to other
nerve cells. Dopamine starts flooding the brain’s reward system, and the system
becomes overstimulated. When triggered by alcohol or another drug, the brain
releases two to ten times more dopamine than it does when you eat something deli-
cious or have another natural and pleasurable experience like listening to music or
having sex (Di Chiara and Imperato 1988). The exaggerated sense of pleasure, or
euphoria, that you experience when this happens leads to an intense desire to repeat
the experience.

Our natural pleasure response involving dopamine was designed to promote sur-
vival. The experience of pleasure that we get from eating, intimacy, and other enjoy-
able activities is the reason that we repeat these acts. These acts are vital; without
food and human contact we cannot stay healthy or live for very long. But the plea-
sure response that is triggered by repeated alcohol and drug use has the opposite
effect—rather than promoting survival and well being, it causes emotional and

27


The Addiction Recovery Skills Workbook

physical suffering, a diminished ability to experience pleasure, and a diminished ability
to carry out life-sustaining activities (such as working, eating, and taking care of
yourself), while at the same time compelling a person to continue to drink or use.

As destructive as this cycle is, biologically it actually makes sense. Here’s what
happens: with repeated drug or alcohol use, the brain’s production of dopamine
becomes depleted, and with less dopamine available in the brain, using alcohol or
drugs just doesn’t work as well to produce that intense euphoria or high. And neither
does anything else, for that matter. When we don’t have enough dopamine in our
brains, the things that used to bring us pleasure just don’t do the trick anymore; this
loss of pleasure can lead to depression, hopelessness, and a lack of interest in the
things that we once enjoyed.

When people are in this predicament, not only do they feel the need to drink or
use drugs to try and bring their dopamine back to the way it used to be, but they
need to use larger amounts of alcohol and drugs to trigger that same dopamine rush
they experienced back when all of this started. This is known as tolerance. You may
recall from chapter | that tolerance is one of the warning signs that a person is at risk
of transitioning from social use of alcohol or drugs to addiction. You may also have
heard the popular expression “chasing that first high.” That’s when you keep on
trying, in vain, after becoming addicted to something, to get back to a high that is
just like the first one you ever had on it. As you are now learning, the trouble is, once
you build up tolerance, you just don’t have enough dopamine to get to that place
anymore. That is why, when you cross that threshold and become addicted, the
“chase” can never be satisfied.

In the longer term, addiction leads to other brain changes that make it hard to
give up your use of alcohol and drugs. The parts of your brain that work together to
enable you to control and plan rational behavior, such as the frontal lobe, can be
damaged by excessive alcohol or drug use. At the same time, brain chemicals that
influence your ability to learn can become depleted, causing problems with your
ability to think and reason. When this happens, seeking out ways to get and use
alcohol or drugs can come to resemble a habit that a person repeats without even
realizing it. It becomes like a reflex, something you do automatically without
thinking—especially when you're in a place or with a person you associate with
drinking or using. In fact, understanding how people, places, and things can be asso-
ciated with drinking or using is going to be a very important part of overcoming your
addiction.

28


Addiction Is a Brain Disease

How Addictive Behavior Is Learned

If you know a little bit about psychology, you have probably heard of Pavlov and
his scientific experiments. Pavlov was interested in learned behavior, especially a
process called associative learning, in which a pair of stimuli or experiences can become
associated with one another. In his famous experiment using his dog, Pavlov found
that if he rang a bell just before feeding his dog, and he did this over and over again,
his dog could learn to anticipate or expect that the food was coming just upon hearing
he bell ring. This became apparent to Pavlov when the dog began salivating every
time he heard the bell, even before he could see or taste any food. The learned asso-
ciation between the sound of the bell and the experience of eating was so strong that

the dog developed what is called a conditioned response to the bell. Salivating is a con-
ditioned response that is designed to prepare the body to eat.

In the same way that Pavlov’s dog learned that the bell was a cue that signaled that
food was coming, people can “learn” addictive behaviors. When you drink or use
drugs frequently around certain people or in certain places, you learn to associate
those people or places with the experience of being high or intoxicated. People and

places become “cues” just like the bell in Pavlov’s experiments. These cues create an
anticipation of drinking or using drugs and all of the feelings that go along with being
intoxicated or high. That anticipation can create an intense urge or craving.
Emotions can become cues as well; when you drink or use drugs repeatedly when
you are in a certain emotional state (for example, when you are angry, sad, or nervous),
then the emotional state itself can become a conditioned cue. For these reasons, being
around people, places, or things (such as emotions) that remind you of drinking or
using can trigger powerful cravings that are so uncomfortable that drinking or using
seems like the only choice. These cravings are your conditioned response to drug and

alcohol cues.

Retraining the Brain

When Pavlov’s dog salivated in response to the bell, it was like a reflex. When
addiction takes hold, your reactions to alcohol or drug cues can become very auto-
matic, much like reflexes. Our most basic reflexes are controlled by the lower, more
primitive part of our brains, including the brainstem. Can you recall a time when you

29


The Addiction Recovery Skills Workbook

found yourself drinking or using and you couldn't recall how you even decided or
started to drink or use? If so, that is because the addicted part of your brain was
driving your behavior.

We will continue to refer to your addicted brain throughout this workbook; this is
the part of your brain that will tempt and drive you to fulfill your impulses. These
impulses make you feel like you “need” to drink or use, especially when you encoun-
ter cues that trigger cravings. To overcome your addiction, you will need to learn to
purposely retrain the more sophisticated, rational part of your brain, which involves
your frontal lobe. As you work your way through the exercises in this book, this is
exactly what you are going to learn to do!

We will also refer to your rational brain throughout the workbook, to highlight the
ways in which the addicted and rational parts of your neurobiology will conflict, and
help you train your rational brain to become stronger. The frontal lobe controls ratio-
nal behaviors. These behaviors are the outcome of a decision process, the kind that
involves considering the pros and cons of your actions and choosing between
alternatives—just as Jody did when she had to decide whether to drink and smoke
pot the night before an important meeting.

When you learn to use your rational brain to make decisions about drinking or
using in recovery, you will tune in to your cravings so that you realize what is hap-
pening in your body and mind in that moment, have an internal dialogue about it,
and then choose how to respond to it, rather than reacting to it automatically, like a reflex.
Because of the way your brain has been affected by drug or alcohol use, your auto-
matic, reflexive reaction will be to drink or use drugs in many situations. Learning to
control that reflex is what recovery is all about. You will learn how to do this in chap-
ters 3 through 10.

The following table summarizes some of the brain structures and chemicals that
are affected by addiction, and how these brain changes influence behavior.

How Treatment Works

You might be wondering, If addiction is a brain disease, then how exactly does treatment fix
that? Just as much of your addictive behavior has been learned, recovery-oriented
behaviors are also learned. You can’t erase your brain’s memories of using drugs and
alcohol in response to various conditioned cues—whether those cues are people,
places, or things. Those cues will probably make you uncomfortable by triggering
cravings for a while. But you can learn new responses to those cues, while you give
your brain the time it needs to heal. The longer you are able to remain abstinent from
alcohol or drugs, the greater your chances of successfully living without drinking or
using in the long term. In part 2 of this workbook, you will learn three sets of thera-
peutic skills to help you achieve abstinence from alcohol or drugs: cognitive behav-
ioral therapy, motivational techniques, and mindfulness strategies.

Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). CBT is a therapy approach that has been
used very effectively to help people with a wide range of problems, including addic-
tions of all kinds, mood and anxiety disorders, weight control, chronic pain manage-
ment, and other mental and physical health conditions. When applied to changing
addictive behaviors, CBT is also referred to as relapse prevention therapy. The tech-
niques offered by CBT are based on the understanding of addictive behaviors as
learned, conditioned responses to people, places, and things that have been associ-
ated with drinking and using. The goals of CBT are to help you (1) understand how
your addictive behaviors were learned and conditioned; (2) identify the people, places,
and things that have been conditioned to bring on cravings to use substances (in
other words, your triggers); and (3) learn healthy coping responses to these triggers
that enable you to remain abstinent from drug or alcohol use.

CBT is probably the most well studied form of psychotherapy for addictions.
There have been literally dozens of clinical trials comparing CBT to other forms of
addiction treatment, and the results consistently show that this approach effectively
reduces drug and alcohol use for people with various types of addictions, including
stimulant (Rawson et al. 2004), marijuana (Budney et al. 2006), alcohol (Annis and
Davis 1989), and opioid addictions (Church et al 2001; McAuliffe 1990; Pollack et al.
2002; Stein et al. 2004).

Motivational techniques. If you're like most people in recovery, since the day you
first realized that you needed to do something about your addiction, your intention

32


Addiction Is a Brain Disease

to quit drinking or using has been at times clear and strong, while at other times less
certain, or even completely absent. This could vary from day to day, or even from
hour to hour. It is simply a reflection of the ambivalence, or mixed feelings, that all
of us have when we are going to make a difficult change. Motivational therapy tech-
niques help you to figure out the source of your ambivalence and resolve it so that
you can move your life forward and commit firmly to making changes (Miller, 1983).

Motivational therapy techniques help you to explore your own ideas about how
recovery could change your life, so that you can come to your own conclusions about
it and become the driver of your recovery plan. Studies show that this approach is
helpful for motivating people with addictions to attend therapy (Hettema, Steele, and
Miller 2005), and when you combine motivational techniques with CBT, they are
especially useful for helping you to quit using alcohol and drugs (Glasner-Edwards et
al. 2013; Rohsenow et al. 2004). In chapter 3, you will complete motivational exer-
cises to help you resolve ambivalence you might have about quitting drinking or
using, and strengthen your commitment to your recovery.

Mindfulness-based relapse prevention. Mindfulness, one of the most well-studied
forms of meditation practice, is a tool that has been recently introduced to the world
of addiction treatment. Originally part of Buddhist meditation practice, mindfulness
was adapted more than thirty years ago for use in a stress reduction program that was
developed by Jon Kabat-Zinn (1982). Since that time, mindfulness has been used
effectively to help with a range of psychological problems, including depression,
anxiety, grief, and stress in individuals with serious medical problems. Mindfulness
meditation, which you will learn about and practice in chapter 7, focuses on two core
skills that can help you in your recovery: (1) learning how to be present in the moment,
using awareness of your breath as a tool; and (2) learning to accept your experience
just as it is, without judging yourself for it or trying to change it. As you will learn in
chapter 7, these skills can be helpful to get you through a craving or to cope with
another unpleasant emotion without turning to alcohol or drugs.

Medications

Medication is an option in the treatment of alcohol and certain drug addictions;
and for some (for example, opioid addiction), it’s crucial, as highlighted by a recent
quote in Time magazine by one of the leaders in the field of drug addiction treatment,

33


The Addiction Recovery Skills Workbook

Dr. Richard Rawson. Discussing use of the medication buprenorphine (which you
will learn more about below) as a means of preventing opioid overdose deaths, which
have increased in recent years, Rawson states, “Failure to encourage patients to use
these medications is unconscionable. It’s comparable to conducting coronary bypass
surgery and failing to prescribe aspirin, lipid, and blood pressure medications as part
of a discharge plan” (Time, Feb 2, 2014).

Combining medication with behavioral therapy techniques can be a very effective
way of treating addiction. The techniques in this workbook are compatible with the
use of medication, which may also help you to achieve a long enough period of time
without relapsing that you can engage more fully in the psychological skills—building
process. Most of the medications for addictions work in one of three ways: (1) by
minimizing the intense cravings that often stand in the way of successfully quitting
drug or alcohol use; (2) by blocking or preventing the “high” or “rush” that you expe-
rience when you use alcohol or drugs, making substance use less appealing; or (3) by
substituting for or “replacing” the drug that you are addicted to, keeping a steady
level of a similar chemical in the system. Although historically the idea of using a
medication or “drug” to treat a “drug problem” has been controversial, as addiction
has become better understood as a chronic illness requiring ongoing treatment, much
like diabetes and heart disease (McLellan et al. 2000), medications for addiction have
been demonstrated scientifically to save lives, reduce deaths by overdose, improve
overall quality of life, and enable people with addictions to flourish as productive
members of society.

The table that follows summarizes the available medications that are approved by
the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and currently used, most successfully in
combination with behavioral therapies. There are a few additional medications that
are not FDA-approved but have been studied in clinical trials and show promise for
the treatment of addictions; these include Topamax, Zofran, Seroquel, and baclofen.

The Brain Heals; So Do You

As strong as the evidence is that addiction has damaging effects on the brain,
scientific studies have shown that the brain has a remarkable potential for recovery.
In one study, using brain imaging techniques, the researchers studied images of the
brains of people who were addicted to methamphetamine, looking at changes in the
images repeatedly over fourteen months of recovery and comparing them to healthy
individuals who had never used drugs. They found that, over time, the brain’s poten-
tial to make dopamine, which was quite compromised at the beginning of the study,
gradually recovered among those who remained abstinent from drugs (Volkow et al.
2001).

Even more recently, a group of scientists completed a similar brain imaging study,
except that this study was designed to find out whether behavioral therapy for addic-
tion could produce changes in brain activity in areas of the brain that are thought to
be damaged by addiction. The researchers found that individuals who received cogni-
tive behavioral therapy to treat their addictions showed improvement from the start
to end of treatment on a test of impulse control and other cognitive abilities. They
also showed changes in brain areas that control rational decision-making and “self-
control,” or the ability to control your responses to your impulses (DeVito et al.
2012).

What does this mean for me? you might be wondering. It means that, with the right
therapeutic skills in place, such as those you will learn in this workbook, not only can
you learn to control your behavior as it relates to drug and alcohol use, and recover
your ability to make healthy decisions, but you can experience pleasure again from
ordinary, naturally enjoyable experiences. When drugs and alcohol take hold and you
lose control, it is easy to feel hopeless, especially when the depression sets in. The
great news about these scientific studies is that they show that your life can return to
normal if you receive treatment using the techniques we are focusing on in this work-
book, and are able to remain abstinent from drugs and alcohol.

Addiction Is a Brain Disease

Wrap-up

By now, you have a deeper understanding of how addiction affects the brain. Many
of your addictive behaviors can be explained by the neurobiological changes you have
endured from your drug or alcohol use. In this chapter, you learned how rational
decision-making is affected by chronic drinking and drug use. We reviewed how
addictive behaviors are learned, and how they can become automatic. The therapy
techniques you will learn in the chapters that follow can help you to learn new
responses to the cues that previously triggered alcohol or drug use. By “relearning”
how to respond to these cues in a healthy way without drinking or using, you are
strengthening your rational brain, while disengaging from your addicted brain. This
will allow you to heal and rebuild your ability to make rational choices. In the next
chapter, we will begin working on strengthening your motivation for recovery.

yet the next day, or even the next hour, you can find yourself coming up
with reasons why it might be okay to drink or use just one more time? Believe it or

not, there are theories in psychology about w

The Addiction Recovery Skills Workbook

How We Change

Psychologists have spent decades trying to understand the process of behavior change.
What has to happen inside of our minds to motivate us to change behaviors that have
been habits for a very long time? One of the most well-studied theories about this is
called the transtheoretical model of behavior change (Miller 1996). In the addiction
treatment field, this model has been widely used to understand and improve motiva-
tion for recovery. According to this theory, there are five different stages of motiva-
tion for change, involving thinking about, planning, starting, and sustaining behavior
changes. No matter where you are in the cycle, you can move back and forth between
the stages, and every person moves through the stages and changes at a different

pace. Let’s take a look at the different stages:

42

¢ Precontemplation: The first stage in the cycle is called precontemplation.

This is the stage when you're not even really aware that you need to make
any changes to your behavior. Maybe others around you have taken notice
of your alcohol or drug use and are talking to you about their concerns, but
it hasn't registered for you personally. Since you've picked up this work-
book, you are more than likely beyond this stage, but you can probably
remember a time when you felt a little burdened and maybe even defensive
about other people’s concerns regarding your use of drugs and alcohol,
because you didn’t share them. That was when you were in the precontem-
plation stage.

Contemplation: The second stage is just what it sounds like—it is when
you're starting to think about the possibility of changing. The themes that
would be going around in your head in this stage are maybe I need to make
some changes, or maybe drinking isn’t good for me anymore, or maybe I can’t control
my drug use anymore. At this stage, you're starting to realize that your current
behavior patterns are not matching up with the way you want your life to
be.

Preparation: When you enter the third stage, you are convinced that you
need to change your behavior and you begin planning for it. This would be
the stage when you start exploring ways that you can get help with your
alcohol or drug use. Some signs that you are in the preparation stage could
include:


Step 1: Strengthen Your Motivation and Commit to Change

* Making an appointment to see an addiction specialist
* Considering different treatment options for your addiction
* Setting a date for when you are going to quit drinking or using

* Reading through this book and planning to start the exercises

¢ Action: When you enter the action stage, you have initiated the plans you
made during the preparation stage. This could mean that you have started
treatment, are working your way through the exercises in this book, have
started to go to mutual self-help groups (such as 12-step meetings), or have
already cut back or quit your use of alcohol or drugs.

¢ Maintenance: When you've been able to remain consistent in making the
changes you committed to in the action stage for six months or longer, you
will transition to the maintenance phase. For example, if your action stage
involves quitting your use of alcohol or drugs, you would move into the
maintenance stage once you've been sober for six months.

Of course, in the process of recovery from addiction, a slip or relapse can naturally
interrupt your progression through this sequence of stages, but it doesn’t have to put
you right back at the beginning. The way that you respond to a relapse makes a huge
difference in your ability to regain momentum in your recovery. If you catch yourself
early, and are able to prevent a slip from turning into a full-blown relapse, you can get
right back into the action phase, rather than winding back to an earlier phase and
feeling “stuck” there. Throughout this section of the book, you are going to learn
skills that help you to understand and move beyond a slip before it gets out of hand.

Exercise 3.1: What Stage of Change Are You In?

Review the above descriptions of the five stages of change. Circle which stage you are in with

Now, circle the rating that describes how motivated you are to take the necessary steps
to achieve abstinence, on a scale from 0 to 10, with zero being not at all motivated and 10
being the most motivated:

Looking at your responses to these two items, there are a few things to keep in mind. First,
if you circled Action or Maintenance, congratulations! You're well on your way to a healthier
new chapter of your life. Keeping your motivation strong will be important to sustain the
changes that you are already making, so be sure to complete the exercises in this chapter.
If you circled Preparation, this chapter is an ideal place for you to solidify your reasons for
initiating a change and moving into Action. If you circled Precontemplation or Contemplation,
then it’s great that you are getting educated about addiction by reading this book and con-
sidering whether making a change to your alcohol or drug use is something that you'd like to
pursue further. On the rating scale, if you gave yourself less than a 5, you are probably in an
early stage of change (such as precontemplation or contemplation). If you gave yourself a 5
or above, some part of you—whether it is just a small part or all of you—has already decided
to take steps to change your alcohol or drug use.

Regardless of which stage of change you are in, take a look at your self-rating for
motivation, and ask yourself this question: What would it take to move me up just one more
point on the scale? If you don’t know the answer to that right now, don’t worry. As you
consider the pros and cons of changing your alcohol or drug use, as well as the reasons
why it might be worth changing, you will get a better idea of how to answer that
question.

Ambivalence: It’s Normal in Recovery

No matter how motivated you feel about your recovery and its importance in your
life right now, it is very normal to feel ambivalence, or mixed feelings, about the process
of changing your behavior and lifestyle (Prochaska, DiClemente, and Norcross 1992).
Even though your use of alcohol or drugs has caused problems for you that have led
you to think about changing, there was a reason that you started drinking or using
in the first place. The reason was, it was doing something that felt good or helpful to

44


Step 1: Strengthen Your Motivation and Commit to Change

you—whether it was making you feel positive emotions or enhancing your ability to
function in some way, or removing unpleasant feelings.

It is important to acknowledge that there were some positive rewards that you got
out of drinking or using back when you started, and the hope to continue to get those
benefits can lead you to have mixed feelings about giving it up, even if you haven't
experienced many positives from drinking or using for a while. Those memories are
powerful, and your addicted brain will tempt you to seek out alcohol and drugs in
attempts to repeat these positive experiences. As you examine your motivation for
change, you will begin the process of strengthening the power of your rational brain
to control your addictive behaviors.

If you're anything like most people who enter recovery, you've been using alcohol
or drugs for a while, so it may be hard to imagine life without it. You might even feel
like you're setting yourself up to fail, because you don’t believe that you can change
successfully. These anxieties are completely normal. The good news is that they are
not rational! Why is that good news? Because once you recognize that your thoughts
or feelings are irrational, it’s easier to change them. The reality is, many people who
have been drinking and using for a long time are able to give it up and turn their lives
around. It’s not easy, but with a solid recovery plan—which you're building with the
help of this workbook—and the right support in place, it is entirely possible.

In the next section, you'll consider some of the pros and cons of continuing to
drink or use versus cutting back or quitting your use of alcohol or drugs. One thing
to keep in mind as you complete this exercise is that the immediate or short-term
benefits of drinking and using (such as improving your mood) are often the exact
opposite of the longer-term effects, which come a little bit later. These can include
depression or other mood disturbances, and the inability to get important things
done. Being realistic about these short- and long-term effects is important so that you
can take an honest look at the full range of benefits and drawbacks that come with
each possible decision (such as continuing to drink or use versus changing your use
patterns).

Exercise 3.2: Resolving Your Ambivalence

The best way to resolve any mixed feelings you might have about changing your use of drugs
or alcohol is to give some serious consideration to the benefits of stopping your use and
weigh them against the things about drinking or using that you will miss. In this exercise,

45


The Addiction Recovery Skills Workbook

you're going to think about this in four different ways. First, you’re going to think about the
reasons why you drink or use—the positives. Here are a few examples of things people like
about drinking or using:

It helps with anxiety.
It helps with relaxation.

It provides an escape from things that are difficult to cope with.
It can be fun.

It breaks the ice in social situations.

Second, you're going to think about some of the negative things that happen when you
drink or use. This will help motivate you to change your behavior, especially if you can keep
this list in mind when you experience a craving. Here are some negative effects of drinking or

drug use that you might experience:

t causes health problems, including physical discomfort when the substance wears
off, getting sick, and longer term effects of certain substances (for example, liver
damage, heart disease, and oral health problems).

t causes or worsens psychological symptoms or illness, such as anxiety and depression.
t creates financial problems.
t leads to relationship difficulties.

it causes you to have difficulties meeting your obligations at work, school, or home.

Third, you'll come up with a list of the benefits of reducing or quitting. Some of the ben-
efits that you might discover are as follows:

46

Feeling better physically
Having more predictable and stable emotions
Becoming more productive

mproved relationships (this happens more gradually, usually)

Feeling better about yourself

Saving money


Step 1: Strengthen Your Motivation and Commit to Change

Fourth, you'll spend some time thinking about the things you will miss about drinking or
using. Some of the drawbacks of reducing or quitting your use of alcohol or drugs might
include:

* Missing the immediate positive effects of drinking or using on your mood or your
ability to do certain things

¢ Losing or distancing yourself from friends you like because they might tempt you to
drink or use

¢ Feeling more limited in the range of social or work activities you can participate in
comfortably

* No longer being able to lean on alcohol or drugs to cope with stress or problems

Now, complete your own matrix below of the pros and cons of reducing or quitting sub-
stance use versus continuing to drink or use drugs. Be as open and honest as you can when
you make this list; the better you understand the sources of any mixed feelings you have about
this, the more equipped you will be to talk yourself through them when the urge to drink or
use comes up.

To use the results of the matrix to help you in your recovery, find a place where you can jot
down the drawbacks of continuing to drink or use, as well as the benefits of reducing or quitting
your use. Some people like to store this in their notes on their cell phone, or even on their cell
phone wallpaper for a more consistent reminder. For others, writing it down on a little index
card or slip of paper and carrying it around (in a wallet or purse) can be useful. Pull out the
card or look at the list on your phone any time you experience a craving, to remind yourself of
what you are getting out of your recovery, as well as what you stand to lose if you slip or relapse.

Remember that your addicted brain will persuade you to drink or use by enticing you with
memories of the acute, or short-term, positive effects of alcohol or drugs. The negatives and
drawbacks of drinking and using typically come afterward. But if you start thinking about them
before you make the decision about whether or not to drink or use, you will strengthen your
rational brain and increase your chances of successfully overcoming a craving without relapsing.

Boosting Your Motivation

Earlier in this chapter, you rated your motivation to reduce or quit drinking or using.
You were also thinking about what it would take to move your rating up by at least

48


Step 1: Strengthen Your Motivation and Commit to Change

one point, to make your motivation stronger. The exercise you are going to complete
next will give you some things to think about that might help you answer that ques-
tion. It will involve answering some questions to help you consider more carefully the
concerns that you have about your drinking or drug use, the impact of your use on
your life now and in the future, and your confidence in your ability to abstain from
alcohol or drugs.

First, let’s look at an example.

Carrie Considers Change

Carrie has been smoking pot on a daily basis for the past eight years. In general,
she’s been very functional for most of that time. She’s held down a few different
jobs as a production assistant in the television industry, she’s had a long-term
relationship (which she recently ended), and she has kept up a pretty active social
life. Lately she’s been noticing that she has a lot of anxiety. She has found herself
obsessing about past decisions (such as breaking up with her most recent boyfriend),
and questioning whether they were right or wrong. She has also noticed that she’s
been thinking a lot about her career and wondering why she hasn't really advanced
rom the level of assistant to something a little higher up.

These thoughts have had a depressive effect, leading her to smoke pot more
often than before. Since this cycle started, Carrie has felt less motivated to get out
and do the things she normally enjoys, like socializing, exercising, and spending
time with her family. She has noticed a connection between smoking pot and
eeling depressed and anxious, which she wasn’t aware of before. Although smoking
pot helps her to detach from a lot of the things she is unhappy about, Carrie has
noticed that when she smokes more heavily, she enters a period of several days of
not feeling like herself. On those days, she feels sad, irritable, and extra tired, and it
takes a big effort for her to focus on things she needs to do at work and at home.

Carrie goes to see a psychologist for an evaluation, and one of the themes that
they discuss is the connection between her use of marijuana and the problems she
has been experiencing. When she comes to the appointment, Carrie is in the
contemplation stage of change concerning her use of marijuana—she is starting to
put together some thoughts about how it is affecting her, but she does not yet have
a plan in mind about what she is going to do about it. She rates her motivation to
change her marijuana use at a 5. She is somewhat motivated, but she has some

49


The Addiction Recovery Skills Workbook

ambivalence about it, especially since she’s been using pot for so long and doesn’t
think it has affected her in many negative ways. Carrie’s psychologist suggests that
she consider four aspects of her thoughts about marijuana that will help her explore
her ambivalence and strengthen her motivation to make a change:

¢ Recognizing Marijuana Use as a Problem: Is it a problem or isn’t it a
problem? It may sound like a simple question, but when you have mixed
feelings about the idea of changing your behavior, you may find yourself
questioning whether your hunch (that drinking or using is the source of
some, or even most, of your problems) is correct. Carrie’s psychologist asks
her some questions about how she has noticed marijuana causing problems
for her, and what kinds of things it’s interfering with. These questions lead
Carrie to the following observations:

* It is having an effect on my mood.
° It is increasing my anxiety.
* It interferes with my ability to concentrate and be productive at work.

* It interferes with my motivation to do things I normally love doing, like spending
time with my friends and family.

* I’m wondering if it might be holding me back from getting further in my career. (If
I had more energy and motivation, maybe I would be more proactive.)

¢ Concern About Marijuana Use: Often people who seek help for alcohol-
or drug-related problems say that they have family members or friends who
have expressed concern about their use. Though this is very important, and
often sets the wheels in motion for exploring the problem further, there is
nothing more powerful for motivating change than_your own concerns about
the effects of your behavior on your life. Carrie’s psychologist asks her to
reflect on her own worries about her marijuana use. She asks Carrie to
imagine what she fears will happen if she continues to smoke pot as much
as she does right now for the next year or more. In other words, what is she
concerned will happen if she doesn’t make any changes? Carrie expresses
the following concerns:

* I could become more depressed and anxious.

50


Step 1: Strengthen Your Motivation and Commit to Change

* I might become very isolated.

* If I keep on going to work spaced out after I've been smoking pot heavily, I might
start making mistakes and I could get into trouble.

* I could start gaining weight. I'm already exercising less, and I get hungrier when
I'm smoking a lot of pot.

¢ Intention to Change: Recognizing that you have a problem with alcohol
or drugs is one thing, but translating that recognition into action is a whole
other process. Getting from that point of realizing that you have a problem
to committing to making a change is a big and important step. It’s a process
of deciding that change is needed, and that making a change can lead you
to a better place in your life than where you are now. Carrie’s psychologist
asks her to think about why changing her marijuana use is necessary, and
how her life will be different if she is able to change successfully. Carrie’s
responses are as follows:

* I need to stop smoking so that I can find out if it’s the marijuana holding me back
from making progress in my career.

* I need to stop using marijuana so that I can be myself again—this depressed,
anxious person I’ve become just isn’t me.

* If I were able to stop smoking pot, I think I would be a happier, more energetic
person.

* If I were able to stop smoking pot, I think I would be moving up the ladder at
work.

* Optimism: Do you believe that you can successfully change your use of
alcohol or drugs? If you have your doubts, you are not alone. This may be
one of the most challenging changes you make in your life. But studies
show that if you can find reasons to believe in yourself and your ability to
win this battle, you will boost your chances of succeeding (Kelly and Greene
2014). This confidence in yourself is called self-efficacy. To help improve
Carrie’s self-efficacy, her psychologist asks her to think of reasons that she

51


The Addiction Recovery Skills Workbook

can believe in her ability to succeed in her recovery. Here are the reasons
she comes up with:

* I'ma very strong person. When I’m determined to do something, I always follow
through.

* I have a strong support system for my recovery. My friends will support me, and
I have several who don’t smoke pot and will be very happy to see me finally quit.

* I’ve made other difficult changes before—like when I quit smoking cigarettes—and
I succeeded at those.

After Carrie completes this exercise, she finds that she has reached a new level of
self-understanding about the ways that marijuana use has been affecting her life,
her concerns about the effects it could have on her in the future, the things that
could change for the better if she were to change her use of marijuana, and the
reasons she has to be confident that she can change her marijuana use. After
reflecting on all of these things, she finds that her motivation rating has changed
from a5 toa 7.

Exercise 3.3: Motivation for Change

Now it’s your turn to consider your thoughts about alcohol or drugs in the same four areas
that Carrie did. This exercise will help you to explore your ambivalence about changing and
express your motivation for change in your own words.

1. Consider whether alcohol or drug use is a problem for you.

What kinds of problems have you had in relation to your use of alcohol or drugs? Describe
them here:

52


Step 1: Strengthen Your Motivation and Commit to Change

How has your use of alcohol or drugs interfered with, or stopped you from, doing things
you wanted to do?

2. Think about what concerns you about your alcohol or drug use.

Is there anything that worries you about your use? Is there anything you can imagine hap-
pening to you because of it? If so, describe your concerns here:

What, if anything, are you worried will happen if you don’t cut back or stop drinking or
using?

53


The Addiction Recovery Skills Workbook

3. Think about how changing your alcohol or drug use will affect your life.

What makes you think that you might need to cut back or quit your use of alcohol or
drugs?

If you change your use of alcohol or drugs successfully and things work out the way you
want them to, how do you imagine your life will be different?

4. Think about the reasons that you can believe in yourself and your ability to
change.

What inspires you to believe that change is possible for you?

54


Step 1: Strengthen Your Motivation and Commit to Change

Now that you have given more thought to your motivation to change your alcohol or
drug use, let’s revisit the motivation rating that you completed earlier. Circle the rating that
describes how motivated you are to take the necessary steps to change your alcohol or drug
use on a scale from 0 to 10, with zero being not at all motivated and 10 being the most
motivated:

0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
Not Motivated Somewhat Motivated Motivated Highly Motivated

Did your rating change from earlier? If so, that is great news! You will find that keeping
that rating as high as it can be is something you may need to work at during different stages
of change—even the maintenance stage. The reason for this is that at every stage of change,
those ambivalent or mixed feelings about drinking or using can (and naturally do) come up.
Even when you're completely stable in your recovery, you may find yourself tempted to drink
or use occasionally, and then you'll need to revisit the potential benefits and drawbacks of
that choice, to take a realistic look at your motivation for sobriety.

If your motivation rating did not change from earlier in this chapter, that is perfectly okay;
maybe it was high to begin with and these exercises were simply a reminder of your reasons
for that. If your motivation was not so high to begin with and it did not change, then it is
good that you are being honest about where you are, and you can revisit the exercises in this
chapter any time you think that you might have some perspective to add to strengthen your
motivation. Working with a therapist might also be helpful.

Finally, whether you moved up on the scale or not, don’t hesitate to push yourself further.
By asking yourself what it would take for you to increase your rating by just one more point,
you can continue to strengthen your motivation. Keeping the issue of your motivation on your
mental radar is a big part of making it solid and maintaining it.

Wrap-up

By now, you have a better understanding of the psychology of behavior change, the
specific stage of change that you're currently in, the strength of your motivation to
change your alcohol or drug use right now, and your reasons for wanting to change.
This understanding is the foundation for your recovery, but it is just the first layer.
Next, you need a plan for how you are going to go about establishing the support that

55


The Addiction Recovery Skills Workbook

you need to succeed in achieving your goals. You also need skills that will enable you
to plan for and get through difficult situations without drinking or using.

As you move through the next six chapters of this workbook, you will learn to
apply cognitive behavioral, motivational, and mindfulness-based skills to the specific
types of triggers, temptations, and roadblocks you face in your recovery. By the time
you finish with section 2 of this book, your personalized relapse prevention plan will
be in place and you will have mastered the tools that are the most helpful to you to
achieve long-term recovery.

56


CHAPTER 4

Step 2: Set Yourself
Up to Succeed

n the last chapter, you explored and strengthened your motivation for recovery.
Now that you have clear in your mind the reasons why you want and need to
change your use of alcohol or drugs, it is time to make certain adjustments in
your life that will set you up for the smoothest possible road to recovery. To maxi-
mize your chances of success, you will need to be prepared for the challenges that
come along in early recovery. Many of these are going to be right in front of you, in
your immediate environment; they can include people, places, and things that trigger
urges to drink or use. Some of these triggers will be easier for you to manage than
others. This chapter will prepare you to anticipate these challenges and plan ahead
for them.
You're going to learn about several different ways to be prepared for the obstacles
that lie ahead: First, you'll learn about why you'll need to get things that might tempt
you to use out of your home environment. You'll also learn how to be mindful of your
recovery when making everyday decisions that can affect it. And you will read about
the importance of introducing an exercise program into your recovery plan. Next,
you'll give some thought to your social life, and ways to increase your social support
for recovery. Finally, you'll learn how to enhance your current close relationships and
enlist the help of your loved ones in your recovery by using assertive communication.

Get Rid of “Stuff” That Helps You
Drink Or Use

As your addiction developed, you formed very powerful associations between drink-
ing or using and the “stuff” that you used to do it. What kind of stuff? you might be
wondering. That depends on what your preferred substance is. Let’s take pot, for
example. Rolling papers, bongs, and pipes are examples of the different types of things
that helped you to use. Now, those things themselves, because of the strong associa-
tion in your mind between them and using pot, can trigger very strong urges to get
high. For someone who has just stopped smoking pot, opening a drawer and finding
a pipe in it can create a powerful craving. For this reason, getting all of that stuff out
of your immediate environment (your home, backpack, purse, car, or anywhere else
you keep it) is one of the very first steps you will need to take to prevent a slip or a
relapse. If your preferred substance is alcohol, then you might need to get your favor-
ite wine glass or shot glass out of your home. Or if you’ve injected any drugs, then this
would mean getting needles or syringes out of your environment. And most impor-
tant of all, having your substance itself within reach is an extremely powerful trigger.
So if you have leftover pot, alcohol, pills, or other substances that you are trying to
quit using in your home, you'll need to get rid of those as well.

If you’re like most people in early recovery, this is not exactly music to your ears.
You probably have some questions about these rules, and you may have some objec-
tions. Before we address those, take a moment to think about the importance of your
recovery in your life, and the reasons you listed in the last chapter for quitting. Look
back at the list if you can’t remember all of them off the top of your head. Think
about how motivated you are to quit, and whether you are ready to take the neces-
sary steps to do so successfully, even if they are hard at first.

Below, you'll find some very common concerns and reactions that people have to
the idea of getting rid of their “stuff” (also referred to as paraphernalia), followed by
some “recovery friendly” ways to think about these concerns.

* Concern: Why do I have to get rid of all of this stuff? It has value; I hate to throw
it away.

58


Step 2: Set Yourself Up to Succeed

Recovery mindset: Although it’s true that all of these things cost money,
think about how much continuing to drink or use will cost you, both finan-
cially and in other ways. Your priority right now is to put as many barriers
between yourself and a relapse as you can. Having all of this stuff around
makes it easy for you to drink or use on a whim. Your goal is to create more
barriers. The value of your paraphernalia is nothing compared to the value
of your new life in recovery.

Concern: What if somebody comes over and wants to have a drink, but I’ve gotten
rid of all of my alcohol?

Recovery mindset: Because drinking alcohol is socially acceptable and
common, this is a common sticking point. Having alcohol around to please
others is something to rethink, even though you may need some time to
come to terms with the risk that this poses to you. Here’s the inner dia-
logue to try and adopt to help you prioritize your recovery: Jf having alcohol
in the house makes me more vulnerable to relapse, then I can’t afford to have it here.
My guests will learn to accept that my place is alcohol-free. If it’s really important for
them to drink, we can plan a social gathering at a restaurant, where they can order a
drink.

Concern: I should be strong enough to have that stuff around me without using it.

Recovery mindset: A lot of people in early recovery come into it with the
idea that willpower is a sign of progress. But there is a saying that has been
used in some of the most effective CBT-based treatments for addiction: “Be
Smart, Not Strong!” (Rawson et al. 2004). What that means is, testing
yourself in an attempt to prove that you have willpower or strength will
place you at risk for a relapse. We know from research studies using brain
imaging that being exposed to visual triggers (such as seeing paraphernalia)
for as little as thirty-three milliseconds can activate the addicted part of
the brain and start a craving (Childress et al. 2008). You can’t always
control whether you are exposed to a trigger, but whenever possible, it is
better for your recovery to be smart and avoid it than to try to be strong
enough to resist it, placing yourself at risk for relapse.

Exercise 4.1: Paraphernalia

Below you'll find a list of some of the things to remove from your immediate environment.
Check off the ones that apply to you:

Alcohol

Pills
Marijuana
Any other drugs that you've used (even if not your preferred substance)
Lighters
Mirrors
Ashtrays

Pipes

Rolling papers
Bongs
Needles

Phone numbers (of dealers or contacts you use to find drugs)—delete from
your phone

Medical marijuana card

Other paraphernalia to get rid of:

60


Step 2: Set Yourself Up to Succeed

Now that you've identified the things to remove, you need a plan. Do you feel
confident that you can get rid of these things on your own, or do you need someone
to do this with you? You can turn to a loved one who is supportive of your recovery,
a 12-step sponsor if you have one, or an addiction treatment provider or counselor.
Make a point of not procrastinating about this; once all of those temptations are out
of your way, things will begin to get a little bit easier.

Become Aware of Seemingly
Irrelevant Decisions

One of the most important psychological adjustments you will make as you enter
recovery is to recognize that a lot of your decisions, from now on, need to be made
carefully, with your sobriety in mind. There are decisions you will make about where
to go, with whom to socialize, and what kinds of things to do for fun that can have
a profound effect on your recovery, even if they don’t seem related. Seemingly irrelevant
decisions are just what they sound like—they are little decisions that you make every
day that may not seem, at the moment, to have any potential impact on your sobri-
ety, because they don’t involve drinking or using directly. But they can move you
closer to a relapse if you're not aware of them. Let’s look at an example:

Jonathan Gets Triggered

Jonathan is a cocaine addict in early recovery. Jonathan was at a friend’s house
watching the Super Bowl. When his team won, he and his buddies were so excited
they wanted to celebrate. His friend Scott suggested that they head down the block
to the karaoke bar. Jonathan hesitated for a moment. Since he’d used cocaine and
alcohol together in the past, his recovery plan involved abstinence from alcohol as
well as cocaine. After a quick deliberation, he thought, Well, why not? I'll just sip on a
soda or something. When they got there, a bunch of other good friends of theirs were
already waiting for them. “Hey, Jonathan!” called an old college buddy, Gregory,
from the bar. “I’ve got your drink all ready for you right here!” When Jonathan
walked up, he saw the ice-cold beer sitting there on the table, and it was just too
hard to resist. I'll just have a beer; what’s the big deal? he thought. After one round

61


The Addiction Recovery Skills Workbook

turned into a few and his friends were still having a good time, one of his buddies
told him that he had some cocaine. Although alcohol was not Jonathan’s “drug of
choice,” drinking had been linked with cocaine use for him in the past. That night,
Jonathan wound up relapsing on cocaine.

Thinking about Jonathan’s relapse, what thoughts come to mind about
seemingly irrelevant decisions? For one, Jonathan was not thinking of the bar as a
risky place. Going with his buddies to a bar after the game was a decision that was
seemingly irrelevant to his recovery from cocaine addiction. This is a common
mistake in thinking; when you expose yourself to a substance that is not your
“drug of choice,” it can still make you vulnerable to relapse to be in a situation
where drinking or using are going on, because it takes you outside of the recovery
mindset. This is especially true in early recovery, when you are very vulnerable—
more so than you might think.

Jonathan also had a plan not to drink alcohol just in case, but that did not work
out so well once he was exposed to temptation and social pressure, when his friend
had a drink sitting there waiting for him at the bar. This was part of the chain
reaction (starting with the decision to go to the bar) that led Jonathan to relapse to
cocaine. With alcohol in his system, Jonathan’s judgment was not as good as it
might have been otherwise. Tracing the situation all the way back to the beginning,
Jonathan’s seemingly irrelevant decision was going to the bar. If he had opted out of
the post-game karaoke bar celebration, he would not have relapsed.

Here are a few suggestions to help you avoid making seemingly irrelevant deci-
sions that will put you at risk:

* Create an awareness of the importance of your moment-to-moment deci-
sions as they affect your recovery.

¢ Consider your full range of options when confronted with a choice that
could impact your ability to stay sober.

¢ Think about the potential risks and benefits of each choice that you can
make.

* Choose the option that will be the most protective of your recovery.

62


Step 2: Set Yourself Up to Succeed

¢ If you end up choosing a risky option, be prepared with an exit plan or a
relapse prevention strategy in place (such as calling a sponsor or supportive
friend if you get triggered or bringing someone with you who will help keep
you motivated for recovery).

Exercise Promotes Addiction Recovery

As you work your way through this chapter and begin thinking about ways of putting
new behaviors into place to increase your chances of recovering successfully, you
should be aware of what some of the most recent research on physical exercise in
addiction recovery has shown. Everybody knows that physical exercise is good for
overall health; you've probably heard somewhere that exercising regularly promotes
both physical and mental well-being. The current guidelines from the Centers for
Disease Control recommend two hours and thirty minutes of moderate aerobic exer-
cise per week (Centers for Disease Control 2015), which can translate to about thirty
minutes of aerobic activity (like walking, jogging, bicycling, or dancing) five days per
week. Muscle strengthening exercises (such as resistance training) are also recom-
mended twice per week. Sound tough to commit to? Well, it’s true that if you've been
out of practice for a while, establishing a consistent regimen is not easy at first. But
the exciting news is, there is a good reason to put in the effort: more and more studies
have shown that physical exercise has beneficial effects on addiction recovery.
According to a recent series of studies (Rawson et al. 2015; Dolezal et al. 2013;
Mooney et al. 2014), people in addiction recovery who do aerobic and muscle strength-
ening exercise according to the guidelines enjoy many positive mental and physical
health benefits: they become more physically fit, they lose weight, they show improve-
ments in psychological symptoms of depression and anxiety, and they are more suc-
cessful in reducing their drug use, compared to a group of addicts in recovery who
receive education about health without being involved in a regular exercise program.
In this same series of studies, it was also found that those who exercised during
recovery showed changes in their brain cells. They had more of the brain’s pleasure
chemical, dopamine, available after they exercised regularly for two months. This is
important because it means that when you exercise in recovery, it can help restore
your ability to experience pleasure and joy—and that can really serve you well,
protecting you from one of the most common reasons that people relapse: negative

The Addiction Recovery Skills Workbook

emotions, including feeling unable to enjoy things. Now that new knowledge has
shown that physical exercise can help you to stay sober and improve your mental
health, it can become a very important and enjoyable part of your recovery plan.

One of the keys to success in making a commitment to exercise is to find some-
thing that you actually enjoy doing for exercise. Think about what you enjoy—do you
like outdoor activities, like hiking, walking, jogging, or rock climbing? Do you enjoy
swimming? Or are you someone who likes to dance, go to the gym and use exercise
equipment, or do some other indoor exercise activity? Whatever you try, be sure it
isn’t something that feels like a chore. If you’ve had the experience of counting down
the minutes until a physical activity is over, then be sure that you don’t select that
one again! If you can find something you like to do, once you find the time to do it
regularly, you won't want to stop. That’s the exercise activity you're looking for. Try
to work daily exercise into your recovery plan. It will help you feel good about your-
self, cope with any negative emotions that might be coming up for you, and stay
sober. Now take a moment to think about what kind of activity might work for you
to help you get “hooked” on exercise.

Exercise 4.2: Selecting and Committing to an
Exercise Activity

Some of the physical activities that | enjoy are:

If it turns out not to be my top choice for a regular exercise activity, as an alternative, | will try

on (date).

days per week.

One way to increase the likelihood that you will follow through on your commit-
ment is to keep track of your follow-through on it, and reward yourself for maintain-
ing your commitment. Think of some ways you might reward yourself for exercising.
You can do something you enjoy afterward—buy a little something for yourself, enjoy
some leisure time with a friend, or do something relaxing (like taking a bubble bath,
sunbathing, or watching a favorite TV show). The point is to acknowledge your
achievement. And be sure that you make the connection as you reward yourself,
telling yourself that the reward is for exercising. You can use the exercise log below to
track your progress.

Exercise 4.3: Exercise Log

This log is where you can write down how often you exercise, and record when you reward

yourself for it. Try and make a point of rewarding yourself for exercising at least once, if not
twice, per week. Use this log as consistently as you can over the next few months, as an aid

to establishing a regular exercise regimen.

Taking Stock of Your Social Support Network

Studies show that social support for your recovery has a strong influence on your
success in staying clean and sober (Kelly et al. 2012). This means that the more
quality relationships you have with people who are supportive of your efforts to stop
using alcohol or drugs, the more likely you are to be able to achieve and sustain your
sobriety in the long run. Some people come into the recovery process with a lot of
loving, supportive people around them who really “get it” and know how to be helpful.
But some don’t. Some have loving people around, but those people don’t really under-
stand their addiction as a disease, and don’t know how to support them in the right
way. You may have a mix of all of these types of people in your life. Regardless of how
your support system may seem right now at this moment, there are ways to build and
adjust it, such as:

¢ Making new friends who are in recovery
¢ Breaking or limiting contact with friends who are triggering

¢ Leaning on your existing friends and family who are the most helpful and
understanding

* Using assertive communication with the ones who want to help but don’t
know how (teaching them how to be helpful to you, if they are willing to
learn)

* Going to marital or family therapy

The first step is to take stock of the social network that currently exists in your
life, and figure out which people, of those you are close to and spend time with, are
sources of social support for your recovery, as well as who might be triggering for you.
People who are triggering are usually either those who drink or use drugs themselves,
and have done so around you, or those who are a source of conflict and negative emo-
tions that ultimately lead to urges to drink or use.

The Addiction Recovery Skills Workbook

Exercise 4.4: Safety Nets Versus Risky Relationships

In this exercise, you are going to think about whom you might consider a “Safety Net” for
you, and which people or relationships are risky. Safety Nets are people who are supportive
of your recovery and who won't do things to jeopardize it (such as offering you alcohol or
drugs, or behaving in ways that are triggering for you). Risky relationships are those that do
the opposite of your Safety Nets—these are relationships with people who would tempt you
to use through their own drug or alcohol use, or through their behavior toward you. Take a
moment to think about friends, family members, coworkers, a 12-step sponsor, or anyone
else who is part of your social network, and list them under the appropriate category.

Now, looking at this list, ask yourself whether you have at least a few solid Safety Nets
whom you can count on to support you when you are having a hard day or need someone
to talk to. If not, don’t despair. There are ways to build this up, which we'll talk about momen-
tarily. Also take a moment now to think about your risky relationships. There are a few ways
to deal with the risky people in your life, depending on who they are and how much contact
you need to have with them:

* Avoid: There are certain risky relationships that you'll want to avoid altogether. Friends
with whom your primary connection was all about drinking or using are generally too
risky to be around. Dealers or people who used to supply you with drugs are people
you should break connections with and avoid.

68


Step 2: Set Yourself Up to Succeed

¢ Limit contact: There may be some risky people you can’t avoid entirely (such as
coworkers you used to drink or use with after hours), but with whom you can limit your
social contact.

¢ Set limits: There may be people (family members, close friends, a spouse, or other
loved ones) who are triggering to you but are not people you can or want to avoid
altogether. The key in those relationships is to set limits.

Setting Limits: Assertive Communication

Learning to communicate assertively can be a very useful tool in your recovery. First,
let’s think about what it means to be assertive. There are three different communica-
tion styles. On the more reserved extreme, there are passive communicators. If you are
passive, you tend to:

¢ Keep your feelings inside
¢ Avoid making requests of other people
¢ Keep your wants and needs to yourself

The problem with this communication style is that you can end up letting other
people take advantage of you, leading you to feel defeated or resentful because your
needs aren't met. And feeling defeated or resentful can fuel other negative emotions,
like depression.

If you are at the other extreme, you might be an aggressive communicator. If you
are aggressive, you tend to:

¢ Demand what you want
¢ Take advantage of others
¢ Deliver your communication with a hostile, rude, or angry tone

The problem with this style is the disrespect it conveys to other people, which also
can have the effect of isolating you from others, since it causes others to create dis-
tance from you to protect themselves.

69


The Addiction Recovery Skills Workbook

Assertive communication is the middle ground that can help you express your
needs effectively during your recovery. When you communicate assertively, you:

¢ Speak respectfully to others

¢ Can make requests of other people without coming across as demanding
¢ Praise or thank others for the good or helpful things they do

¢ Speak your mind in a way that doesn’t make others feel put off

¢ Express yourself in a healthy way, rather than stuffing your feelings

There are many benefits of being assertive. When you are communicating assert-
ively, you are in control of your emotions and your way of expressing them. This
inspires respect from others, making it more likely that they will be willing to meet
your needs or requests, and inviting healthy and open communication in return. You
might be wondering why this is so important for your recovery, and that is a very
good question. Let’s look at a few scenarios.

Rick’s Dilemma

Rick is an alcoholic who has just recently gotten sober. He lives with his girlfriend,
Tanya, who is a social drinker. She likes to drink wine with dinner occasionally,
and she also likes to host dinner parties, during which she usually serves alcohol.
There have been many occasions when, after having friends over, Rick and Tanya
have gotten into arguments because of his drinking. Tanya is very happy that Rick
is in recovery, but they haven't had any conversations about how she can be helpful
to him.

Tanya has continued to drink wine with dinner a few times a week, and she has
had a couple of parties recently during which she served alcohol while Rick was
around. At the most recent party, Rick was tempted to drink, but he knew that
Tanya would get upset if he relapsed. So he waited until she fell asleep that night,
and with the urge still very strong, he went into the kitchen and poured himself a
drink for the first time in over a month. He ended up having five drinks that night
before he went to bed.

70


Step 2: Set Yourself Up to Succeed

Rick’s situation is a common one. It is very difficult to go into recovery and
succeed in your efforts to avoid drinking or using when a partner or close friend con-
tinues to actively drink or use around you. At the beginning of this chapter, we dis-
cussed the importance of removing alcohol, drugs, or anything in your environment
that is associated with drinking or using, to eliminate as many temptations or relapse
triggers as possible. By keeping quiet about the way that exposure to alcohol at home
is affecting him, Rick is being passive by not expressing his need for adjustments to
Tanya. There could be a couple of reasons for this:

¢ Rick may not like the idea of “burdening” his girlfriend or anyone else with
his recovery.

¢ Rick may worry that Tanya won't want to be with him if it means limiting
her use of alcohol or making adjustments to her lifestyle.

* Rick feels that he should be “strong enough” to have alcohol around him
without relapsing.

Do any of these ideas sound familiar? These types of thoughts are often the
reasons why people in recovery don’t express their needs openly. At the root of the
thoughts is the belief that they will be rejected in some way if they ask too much of
others, or the belief that they should be “stronger” than the addiction (and therefore
should not have any needs from other people related to their addiction recovery).
These are what we call recovery-interfering thoughts, ones that stand in the way of your
success in recovery. So, how do you overcome these ways of thinking? Well, first, you
have to recognize them when they occur. Then, you can try having a healthier inner
dialogue to cope with these thoughts and try to change them. Coming back to Rick’s
situation, here are some healthy ways he can talk himself through the recovery-
interfering thoughts that prevent him from asking Tanya for her help (by making
some adjustments, such as removing alcohol from the house):

¢ Recovery-interfering thought: I don’t want to burden my girlfriend with my
recovery.

Assertive, recovery mindset: Although it might be burdensome to her to
make some changes, the effect that Rick’s addiction has had on his rela-
tionship has been way more burdensome, and could create more serious
problems. If she cares about him, she will make whatever adjustments are

71


The Addiction Recovery Skills Workbook

needed to help him. And she won't necessarily feel burdened; maybe she
has been waiting for Rick to come up with one or more ways that she can
help him. You never know how another person feels until you sit down and
have a conversation about it.

¢ Recovery-interfering thought: She might not want to be with me if she has to
make adjustments to her lifestyle.

Assertive, recovery mindset: Hopefully Tanya will not feel turned off by
the idea of making some changes to her lifestyle in support of Rick’s
recovery—such as not keeping alcohol in the house for the time being, and
hosting alcohol-free dinners, or hosting dinners at a restaurant. But if she
does object, then she may need to become more knowledgeable about addic-
tion. If she doesn’t know much about it, she may find it difficult to under-
stand why Rick can’t just control himself when there is alcohol at home. To
educate herself, she can go with him to counseling, or attend an Al-Anon
meeting. Regardless, for their relationship to be successful, Tanya will need
to deepen her understanding of Rick’s addiction, and figure out whether
and how she might be willing to support his recovery.

¢ Recovery-interfering thought: J should be strong enough to be around alcohol
without relapsing.
Assertive, recovery mindset: Remember, “Be smart, not strong!” Even if
Rick thinks that he should be strong enough to exercise willpower and resist
drinking when there is alcohol in his home, the reality is, he isn’t. He has
an addiction and he’s in early recovery. The way to preserve his recovery is
to be smart and remove all triggers from his environment, rather than
trying to prove that he can handle being around alcohol. Accepting that
reality is a big part of recovery.

Now that you know how to talk yourself through some of the thoughts that can
interfere with being assertive, you'll need some practice in the delivery of assertive
communication. Here are some rules of thumb:

Listen Carefully

When you show others that you are listening to them, it helps strengthen the con-
nection between you, so that both you and the person you are talking to can be open

72


Step 2: Set Yourself Up to Succeed

about your feelings, including your wants and needs. There are both verbal and non-
verbal ways of showing someone that you are listening. Here are some examples of
verbal listening skills:

¢ Asking questions to clarify your understanding of what the other person is
saying (such as asking “Why?” or “How?” or “Can you say a little more
about what you mean by that?”)

¢ Summarizing (or paraphrasing) your understanding of what the person has
said to you (for example, “If I heard you right, then you feel like...”)

¢ Using “I” statements when you eventually respond, so that you come across
as owning your feelings and avoid blaming or making false assumptions

about the other person. (For example, rather than saying something like,
“Your anger triggers me to want to use,” you could say, “Sometimes I feel
like you're angry with me. And I don’t cope with that very well. When I
feel you're angry with me, I get the urge to use.” Notice how much “I” is
used in the assertive statement; that is much less likely to put the other
person on the defense.)

Nonverbal skills are also important tools to show another person that you are
listening. A few ways that you can show someone you are listening through your body
language are:

¢ Making eye contact

¢ Using facial movement and expressions to show your interest—such as
nodding and smiling when the other person is talking

¢ Leaning toward the other person, or positioning yourself in a way that
shows you're tuning in

* Keeping distractions (such as your cell phone) out of reach during your
conversation

Ask for What You Need

Once you’ve shown the other person you're talking to that you are tuned in and
listening, if there is something that you feel that you need, you can request it in a

73


The Addiction Recovery Skills Workbook

respectful way. One way to do this is to express your feelings as they relate to what
you're asking for. The phrase would look like this:

| feel when , and

| need

Putting it all together, let’s come back to Rick’s situation. Using the way of phras-
ing his request suggested above, his assertive conversation with Tanya might go some-
thing like this: “I've been doing a lot of work on my recovery, and I’m learning about
some of the things that I need to be successful. You've been very supportive of my
recovery, and because I trust you and I know your intentions for me are good, I need
to tell you something that isn’t so easy for me to admit. I feel very vulnerable when 1
am around alcohol. I’ve noticed that having it around the house and having people
drinking at dinner parties here is hard for me. I get strong cravings to drink. | am
worried that I_am going to relapse, and I need your help and support. Would you be
willing to consider not keeping alcohol at home for the time being?”

In this example, Rick used a lot of the key skills involved in assertive
communication:

¢ He started the discussion by saying something positive to Tanya about
what he appreciates about her (“You've been very supportive...”).

¢ He made several “I” statements, underlined above, about his feelings of
vulnerability to relapse around alcohol (without accusing Tanya and her
use of alcohol of being the reason that he is triggered).

¢ He expressed his own concerns also underlined, about the effect that having
alcohol in the house could have on his recovery.

¢ He made a direct request for Tanya’s help and support (“and I need your
help and support. Would you be willing...”).

Most importantly, he did all of this in a very polite and respectful manner.

In your own recovery, there may be ways you need to set limits with others that
are completely different from Rick’s situation. Some of the ways that you might use
the assertiveness skills you are learning include:

¢ Asking people close to you who have been affected by your addiction not to
repeatedly bring up the ways that they’ve been hurt or upset by your addic-
tive behaviors

74


Step 2: Set Yourself Up to Succeed

¢ Asking your loved ones to be patient with you during your recovery if you
are emotionally up and down or if you need some time to yourself

¢ Explaining how certain behaviors of others (such as arguing, criticizing, or
bringing up the past) may be triggering for you and asking that your partner,
family, or loved ones try to minimize them

¢ Asking a loved one to come to counseling with you to better understand
how to support your recovery

Exercise 4.5: Practice Assertive Communication

Saying No to Offers of Alcohol or Drugs

Social pressure to drink or use causes one in three people in recovery to slip (Epstein
and McCrady 2009). There are various reasons why it might be challenging for you
to turn down these offers: It might be because the urge to use once it’s available is so
strong, it is hard for you to overcome it. Another reason is that you may not be good
at saying no to someone who is pushy. (And some people are alcohol or drug “pushers.”)
You might also worry about what judgments other people might make about you if
you say no.

The most important thing to remember in all of these situations is that your
recovery is your priority, and the temptation to drink or use to please others is some-
thing you'll need to overcome promptly if you're going to stay sober. Drink or drug
“pushers” need to be addressed respectfully but firmly so that they don’t continue to
offer and trigger you. Here’s how to say no, whether to a pusher or to a friendly offer
of alcohol or drugs:

¢ The first thing to say in response to an offer is “no” or “no thank you” in a
serious tone, so that you come across as direct and clear and not “wishy
washy” about your decision.

* Make eye contact when you say no; otherwise you might appear uncertain
of your answer, leaving the door open for the other person to convince you
to change your mind.

76


Step 2: Set Yourself Up to Succeed

¢ Ask for something else instead: “No, thank you. Do you have sparkling
water? That would be great.” Or if someone is offering an activity involving
drug use, you can suggest something else that is not so risky. For example,
if a friend suggests that you go to his house and smoke some weed, you
could say, “No, thanks. I’m hungry, though. Do you want to go out and get
something to eat?”

¢ Try changing the subject.

¢ Ask the person not to offer you alcohol or drugs anymore. Say, “I stopped
drinking,” or “I’ve stopped using,” and assertively ask the person not to
offer any to you. Remember that anyone who continues to offer is not being
respectful to you, and you might not want to spend a lot of time around
that person.

¢ Have a dialogue with yourself about it. Remind yourself why your recovery
is so important. You shouldn't feel guilty about letting others down by not
joining them in drinking or using. That’s a choice they are making for
themselves. But you are choosing to build a healthy life for yourself, and
you deserve that. Part of recovery is learning to be self-protective.

If you have a friend, sponsor, counselor, or loved one who would be willing, try
pairing up and practicing what you will say when you are offered alcohol or drugs. It’s
only a matter of time before that happens, and the more prepared you are, the better
you will handle it.

Expanding Your Social Network

In this section, we will focus on ways of building up your network of support so that
you have at least a handful of Safety Nets you can count on to help you through a
tough moment, day, or period during your recovery.

First, remember that there are a lot of different types of relationships that can be
Safety Nets for you. Your family members—including children, parents, and other
relatives—can be Safety Nets. Members of a self-help group or other community-
based organization (such as a church or temple), professional counselors, friends, or a
romantic partner are other possible Safety Nets. The first thing to pay attention to as
you identify who, for you, is a Safety Net, is the role of alcohol and drugs in that

77


The Addiction Recovery Skills Workbook

person’s life. Is this someone who drinks or uses drugs heavily, or who is likely to
drink or use when around you? Is it someone who would be willing to abstain from
drinking or using when around you? Ideally, your Safety Nets should be people who
either don’t drink or use (or do so very little), or who are willing to abstain around
you.

The next step is for you to think about the qualities that you are looking for in
the people who could be Safety Nets in your life. Use the exercise below to help you
identify these qualities.

Exercise 4.6: Qualities of Safety Nets

People who can be Safety Nets for me will have the following qualities (check all that apply
for you):

Not actively drinking or using

Good at listening

nowledgeable about addiction (or willing to learn)
Respectful toward me

onjudgmental

rustworthy

ind

urturing

Patient

Willing to make time for me

ot flaky
Genuine
Interested in sharing thoughts, perspectives, and ideas

Protective of me and my recovery

78


Step 2: Set Yourself Up to Succeed

Other important qualities of a Safety Net in my life:

If you don’t currently have any Safety Nets in your life, or if you have just a few
and would like to have more, make it a priority to expand your support network.
Having many people to call on for support when you need it is invaluable in any stage
of recovery.

Exercise 4.7: Ways to Expand Your Network

In this exercise, you will list new ways that you plan to try to expand your social support
network.

List at least two ways you can reach out to old friends or potential new ones, such as
joining a volunteer organization, enrolling in a class, or contacting one or more old friends
who are potential Safety Nets:

79


The Addiction Recovery Skills Workbook

List at least two ways you can become part of a community-based organization, such
as joining a mutual self-help group like Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) or Narcotics Anonymous
(NA); attending a religious activity at a temple, church, or other entity; joining a special-
interest group or club; or seeking a professional counselor or other treatment provider:

List at least one way that you can deepen your relationship with one or more of
your family members (a partner, children, or other relatives), such as calling or getting
together more often:

80


Step 2: Set Yourself Up to Succeed

A Word on Mutual Self-Help Programs

Mutual self-help groups are the most widely available and helpful resources that
you can use to build a social support network for your recovery. More and more
studies show that participating in self-help groups enhances social support for recov-
ery, and as a result, contributes in a very meaningful way to success in achieving and
maintaining sobriety (Kelly et al. 2012). There are various self-help groups that use
the 12-step recovery model, including Alcoholics Anonymous, Narcotics Anonymous,
Marijuana Anonymous, and Dual Recovery Anonymous (for people with both addic-
tions and mental health problems), to name just a few. Other self-help groups include
Self-Management and Recovery Training (SMART Recovery), an alternative that
may be a good fit for people who are uncomfortable with the spiritual component of
12-step groups.

It might help to keep the following information and advice in mind as you explore
self-help groups:

* Some people like AA and other 12-step groups and others don’t. It is not
for everybody, but for those who get something out of it, there is potential
for great benefits.

* You don’t have to agree with everything you hear in a 12-step group for it
to be helpful. Remember, it is the social support that is at the core of the
therapeutic benefit, so even if the twelve steps themselves are not all helpful
to you, getting connected with other people in recovery is likely to be
therapeutic in itself.

* Try going to lots of different meetings. Most people need to attend several
different meetings before they find the one that feels like a good fit. There
are different formats to explore. (For example, there are speaker meetings,
in which individuals talk about their experience to the group of attendees,
and there are step study meetings, in which one of the twelve steps is dis-
cussed in depth, and the group will be involved in discussion.)

* Get involved beyond just attending, if you can. Plan to get a sponsor, or
volunteer to take a “commitment” at a meeting (like setting up chairs or

coffee). Studies show that people who get more involved in these ways get
more long-term benefits and have more success in staying sober (Timko
2006).

¢ If you don’t like the spiritual part of the 12-step meetings, try going to a
SMART Recovery meeting, which is more CBT-based.

Wrap-up

Congratulations on working your way through an intense chapter with lots of new
concepts and skills to work on! As you're learning, there are a lot of different ways
that you can lay the groundwork for a recovery-oriented life. It starts with making
your environment safe and free from triggers. Then, you have to start thinking with
your recovery mindset about your day-to-day decisions, to be sure that you are not
setting yourself up for a relapse without realizing it. Next thing you know, you're
rethinking your relationships to figure out who's good for your recovery and who is
not so good, and you're adjusting your communication style with the not-so-good
ones. Then you're looking to make new friends, join new organizations, and go to
self-help meetings. And don’t forget to exercise!

If all of this is a little overwhelming, that is completely understandable. But
remember, you don’t have to make all of these changes at once. Pace yourself with
each of these skills and the exercises that go along with them in a way that’s comfort-
able for you. Once you've put them into practice, you can move on to the next chapter,
where you'll learn to be a “self expert,” so that you can begin to understand how your
personal ways of thinking can set you up for a relapse, and learn how to change them.

CHAPTER 5

Step 3: Become a
“Self Expert”

ow that you have done the hard work of taking an honest look at the prob-

lems that your drug or alcohol use has caused, strengthening your motiva-

tion to change, and creating your change plan, it is important for you to
learn to truly know your addicted self. What does that mean? you might ask. Think
back to when we talked about your “addicted brain” and how it drives you to act in
destructive ways that support your addiction. Step 3 is the first major step you will
take to strengthen your “rational brain” and put it into the driver’s seat.

To do this, you need to know your addicted self inside and out. That means
knowing exactly how, when, and why your addicted brain is most likely to get trig-
gered and start competing with your rational, recovering brain for control. Once you
have that figured out, you will be a “self expert.” In this chapter, you will begin to
learn how to use cognitive and behavioral therapy skills to understand your own
unique patterns of thinking and feeling as they relate to your addiction.

The purpose of this chapter is to teach you three strategies that can help you to
identify the situations and ways of thinking that fuel your addictive behavior: (1)
identifying your unique triggers for alcohol or drug use, (2) recognizing distorted
thinking, and (3) using self-monitoring skills. The more frequently you are able to
recognize and anticipate when your addicted brain is taking hold and causing you to
think and act in irrational, self-destructive ways, the better you will get at intention-
ally using your rational brain to make healthier choices for yourself. Each time your
rational brain wins control over your behavior, your recovery gets a little bit stronger
and your addicted brain loses a little bit of power over your behavior. In the long
term, your rational brain can take over completely, so that making healthy choices is


The Addiction Recovery Skills Workbook

no longer a fight; it is a way of life. In this chapter, and the next, you will learn how
to use cognitive and behavioral therapy skills to become a “self expert” and reclaim
that control.

Becoming a “self expert” is a process of understanding how your addiction con-
trols you, so that, with time and practice, you can turn the tables on it. That means
getting a handle on the wide range of situations, places, people, and experiences that
activate your addicted brain. These are called triggers. Typically, when you encounter
a trigger, this causes a sequence of experiences that leads to drug or alcohol use when
your addicted brain is in control. Here’s how it unfolds:

TRIGGER > THOUGHT > CRAVING > DRUG OR ALCOHOL USE

Does this sequence look familiar? If it does, that’s great! If it doesn’t, that is per-
fectly okay; for many people with addictions, this process happens so quickly that it
takes time and practice just to notice it. This practice is a very important part of the
cognitive behavioral approach. As you progress through the exercises in this chapter,
you will learn to notice when you are triggered, and what exactly that feels like for
you. For instance, when you are triggered, you may or may not be aware of the
thoughts that are going through your head. You may or may not have noticed exactly
what the trigger was. Maybe you are simply aware of an urge or craving to drink or
use drugs, and if so, that is a great start.

As you will learn, there are many components of cravings and people experience
them differently. Some people feel cravings physically in their bodies, while for others
the craving is more of a thought process, like I need it or I can’t handle these feelings
without it. When you learn to self-monitor, you will be able to look at the diagram
above and know exactly what happened during the sequence of TRIGGER >
THOUGHT - CRAVING—physically, emotionally, and cognitively (which refers to
the thoughts you were having). Once you are aware of what happened, you can begin
an inner dialogue with yourself about it, and you can use this inner dialogue to cope
with the thoughts, feelings, and cravings without drinking or using drugs.

Another key component of becoming a “self expert” is developing an awareness of
the kinds of things your addicted brain will tell you to get you to drink or use drugs.
In CBT, these distorted or irrational thoughts are called red flag thoughts. In this
chapter, you will learn about some red flag thoughts that a lot of people with addic-
tions experience when they are feeling triggered. In reviewing these thoughts, you
can identify the ones that you've had, or even come up with your own. This will
prepare you for the next chapter, where you will learn how to “talk back” to the
thoughts using your rational, recovering brain.

Step 3: Become a “Self Expert”

Triggers and Urges

At one time or another, most everyone in recovery experiences urges to drink or use
drugs. In fact, cravings are one of the symptoms that define the disease of addiction
(American Psychiatric Association 2013). That’s no surprise, of course; there are both
biological and psychological explanations for why you would feel a desire to drink or
use drugs after your last drink or dose has left your body. Physically, when you are
addicted to something, your body becomes dependent on having a steady, consistent
dose of it in your system. When that steady dose is diminished, or taken away
abruptly, your addicted brain will communicate urges to you to get you to replenish
it. This is because, as your body is adjusting to receiving less of the substance, you
can experience uncomfortable physical and mental withdrawal symptoms. The con-
ditioned, addicted part of your brain will tell you that you need to drink or use to get
back to feeling normal. That’s the cycle of withdrawal.

The psychological urge or craving can feel just as potent—and sometimes even
stronger. You may recall that in chapter 2, you learned about how your use of alcohol
or drugs can become a conditioned, automatic response to certain cues, much like a
habit. When drinking or using drugs becomes associated, or “linked,” with certain
situations, emotions, people, or things, then those become triggers. Because that psy-
chological link between triggers and using substances can be very powerful, being in
the presence of these triggers can become quite uncomfortable without alcohol or
drugs. You'll experience this discomfort as a craving.

Studies have shown that triggers fall into several categories (Marlatt and Gordon
1985; Larimer, Palmer, and Marlatt 1999). As you become a self expert, think about
which of these categories apply to you, so that you can learn to become more self-
aware when you enter triggering situations:

* Negative emotional states: Some people drink or use drugs as a way of
“self-medicating” uncomfortable emotions such as anxiety, sadness,
boredom, loneliness, or anger.

¢ Interpersonal conflict: Have you ever used alcohol or drugs to cope with
a relationship problem? This is another category of triggers—some people
drink or use when they have a fight with a partner or a family member.
Others get triggered by rejection or criticism at work, school, or home.
Often it is the combination of a conflict and your emotional reaction to it
that places you at risk for a relapse. In other words, it’s not just the fight
with your partner; it’s also the emotion (for example, anger) that it

85


The Addiction Recovery Skills Workbook

86

generates that then leads you to drink or use drugs to cope. In fact, in one
of the largest studies of the reasons people with addictions relapse (Marlatt
1996), more than 50 percent of the relapses were triggered by negative
emotional states stemming from interpersonal conflict. If interpersonal
problems are a trigger for you, then finding a healthier place to put the
anger or other negative emotions that arise is going to be an important part
of your recovery.

Social pressure: Do you feel like you just can’t resist drinking or using
when you are in a social situation where other people are indulging? If so,
you are not alone. For some people, these are the most challenging situa-
tions when trying to abstain from alcohol or drug use. To overcome this
challenge, you first need to understand why this situation is difficult for
you. For some people, it is hard to refuse an offer of alcohol or drugs simply
because it is so tempting. For others, self-consciousness can take over,
leading them to feel worried about how others will think about them or
judge them if they make different choices. This is a very natural tendency
but it is an important one to work through in your recovery. Social pres-
sures to use substances can be direct (for example, someone offering you a
drink or drugs), or indirect (as in being around people who you know have
drugs or who are drinking or using in front of you). You will learn how to
respond to these kinds of social pressures in the next chapter.

Positive emotions: For some people, drinking and drug use is all about
amplifying the good feelings, rather than escaping from or avoiding an
uncomfortable feeling. Maybe you get triggered when you're at a celebra-
tion, or when you are in a very good mood. Or maybe when something
reminds you of the positive emotions or sensations that drinking or using
can bring on for you, you experience a desire to feel those things (like relax-
ation, elation, confidence, or an energy boost). If this is you, then one of

your goals will be to find other sources of positive emotions and rewarding
experiences or activities that are compatible with your recovery. Another
important goal will be to learn to think more carefully about the full range
of effects that you can expect drinking or using drugs to have on you. If
you think it all the way through, you'll find that the positive sensations are
only part of the story. You will practice thinking it all the way through in
the next chapter.

Exercise 5.1: Identifying Triggers

Below you will find a list of triggers that can initiate the sequence of thoughts, cravings, and
behaviors (like drinking or using drugs) that we have been reviewing. Place a check mark
beside the triggers that you have experienced, and place a star next to the ones that you feel
come up repeatedly for you. You'll notice that we've separated internal from external triggers,
so that you can start to learn to distinguish between them. Remember that internal triggers
are just what they sound like; they are emotions inside of you. External triggers, on the other
hand, are cues that are external to you—such as places, people, or situations that you have
come to associate with drinking or using.

Internal Triggers
Depression
Loneliness
Happiness
Excitement
Feeling stressed
Feeling irritable

Feeling overwhelmed

Feeling jealous

Anxiety

Boredom

The Role of Thoughts in Relapse

Now that you have learned what your triggers are, you are ready for the next step:
uncovering the thoughts that lead you to drink or use. Remember, the usual sequence
that can end in a relapse is: TRIGGER > THOUGHT > CRAVING > DRUG
OR ALCOHOL USE. In the exercises that follow, you will start connecting your per-
sonal triggers with specific thoughts.

In everyday life, our thoughts are directly connected to our emotions and our
actions. We all have some thoughts that are rational and some that are irrational. As
someone with an addiction, your irrational thoughts around drinking or using mostly
come from your addicted brain. Thoughts are very important to notice and under-
stand, because when we encounter a trigger—or any stressful or unexpected situation—
the way we think about it dictates the way that we cope with it (Marlatt and Gordon
1985). Let’s look at an example.

Scott Gets Triggered

Scott is a software engineer with alcoholism. He has been abstinent from alcohol for
two months and is doing well in his recovery. One day, he goes to work and his boss
asks to meet with him. Scott’s boss says that one of the clients he has been working
with is complaining that he has been too slow to resolve problems with his new
software, and that he was not very polite in his email when this issue was raised.
Scott’s boss is writing him up, and warns him that he needs to improve his
efficiency and customer service to meet performance standards.

So, there it is: a triggering interpersonal situation. Scott feels devalued by his boss,
leading him to feel inadequate both personally and professionally. Ideally, Scott
would respond to this with some positive coping skills, like finding a healthy outlet
for the emotions that this feedback from his boss brought on. He might try to resolve
things with the client who is upset, and find a way to communicate with his boss
constructively to improve his standing at work. But Scott’s ability to take these
actions depends on the way that he is thinking about the situation, and himself. Let’s

91


The Addiction Recovery Skills Workbook

take a look at some of the thoughts that go through Scott’s head after his talk with
his boss.

* He is picking on me. This just isn’t fair!
¢ I didn’t do anything wrong with that client. I wish I didn’t have to deal with him.
* Nothing I do is ever good enough.

¢ I never succeed at anything. I knew it was just a matter of time before I'd get fired
from this place.

¢ My boss probably just doesn’t like me. Nobody likes me.

If I could just have one drink, it would calm me down.

Scott is stuck in a cycle of negative and irrational thinking. You might notice as
you look at each of his thoughts that he is not stepping back from the situation to try
and evaluate whether there is anything constructive about the feedback his boss gave
him, or whether there is a way to get some resolution to the problem. Instead, his
irrational thoughts take hold; he is quick to interpret many aspects of the situation
as reflections of his own personal inadequacy. It’s as though he is overly sensitive to
any aspects of the situation that could reflect rejection and negativity. Looking at life
from this irrational perspective, it is not surprising that he feels like a failure—an
unlikable and unsuccessful person—and that he predicts that he will be fired.

Scott is not alone; a lot of people (both addicts and non-addicts) can get easily
swept into this irrational way of interpreting and reacting to an upsetting experience.
The key is to recognize what is happening and prevent yourself from “falling for it.”
It is, after all, irrational! If you fall for it, your actions will be irrational too. If you
catch those thoughts when they happen, you can switch gears, engage your rational
brain, and use some positive coping strategies that will lead you away from a relapse.
Let’s break it down further so that you can figure out your own patterns of distorted
thinking.

Distorted Thoughts—Learn to Catch Them!

There are certain types of distorted or irrational thoughts that make you more vul-
nerable to relapse. Like Scott’s distorted thoughts, some are directly related to

92


Step 3: Become a “Self Expert”

drinking or using, while others are not. It’s important for you to know that even the
thoughts that are not directly related to drinking or using can lead you to a relapse.
In Scott’s situation, some of the negative, irrational thoughts he has about himself
(such as Nobody likes me) trigger negative emotions, which he experiences as feelings
of worthlessness. These negative emotions lead him to have thoughts about
drinking.

Have you ever had thoughts about drinking or using after something upsetting
happened to you? If so, it was not just the upsetting event or situation that created
the desire to drink or use; it was the thoughts and emotions that you experienced
during or after the event. Picture the most recent upsetting event that got you think-
ing about drinking or using. Can you pinpoint the thoughts you had in that situation,
just before you started thinking about drinking or using? If so, that is terrific! If not,
on’t worry, you'll get plenty of practice with this.

For some, the hardest part of overcoming irrational thinking is recognizing when
it is happening. That is because most of our irrational thought patterns have repeated
themselves so often over time that they have become automatic. When our thoughts
are automatic, we tend not to notice them. As a “self expert in training,” you are
going to learn to “catch” your thoughts as they happen. Let’s take a look at some of
the most common types of irrational thoughts so that you can start to identify the
ones that you'll need to work on.

fat

Red Flag Thoughts

Because they are directly related to drinking or using, red flag thoughts may be
easier for you to “catch” than other thoughts that can lead you to relapse. A red flag
thought is something that you tell yourself about drinking or using that increases the
likelihood that you will relapse. In CBT, sometimes these are referred to as “relapse
justifying” thoughts or a process of “relapse justification.” In the example above,
Scott’s red flag thought is, Jf I could just have one drink, it would calm me down. These
types of thoughts, that “make it okay” for you to drink or use when you are in recov-
ery, are coming from your addicted brain. When you find yourself having these
thoughts that give you “permission” to drink or use, that’s when you have to work
harder to kick your rational brain into gear and use your new coping skills, which you
will learn in steps 4 through 7. Your job right now is just to notice the thoughts as
they happen.

Exercise 5.2: Identifying Red Flag Thoughts

The following is a list of some common red flag thoughts (Brown et al. 2006). Check all that
you've had at one time or another and add any that you don’t see listed.

| have to... (I have to have a drink.)

Nobody has to know.

It really doesn’t matter if... (It really doesn’t matter if | use.)
I can control it.

I’m only going to have one.

I'm having a bad day; | might as well use.

| deserve to... (I deserve to have a drink.)

It’s a special occasion! | can always start over tomorrow.

Mistakes in Thinking

Now that you have a better handle on your red flag thoughts, it’s time to take a
look at other common mistakes in thinking. Take a look at the six common types of
irrational thoughts that follow, noticing the ones that you relate to the most. Keep in
mind that not everyone experiences every type of irrational thought; if you notice
that there are some types of irrational thoughts you are unfamiliar with, then you
don’t need to come up with a personal example for those.

94


Step 3: Become a “Self Expert”

BLACK-OR-WHITE THINKING

When you see things in black and white, it means that they are either completely
good or completely bad. Scott was caught up in a lot of black-or-white thinking just
before he started entertaining the idea of drinking. When his boss gave him critical
feedback, he started to view himself as completely worthless on the job and a failure—
with thoughts such as Nothing I do is ever good enough, and I never succeed at anything.
When your thoughts contain words like nothing and never, then you're definitely in the
thick of some black-or-white thinking. If you're a perfectionist type, you're more vul-
nerable to this; like Scott, making a mistake causes you to view everything you've
done as useless. Let’s look at an example of how black-or-white thinking can lead to
a red flag thought.

Black-or-White Thought Red Flag Thought

I messed up everything at work. I might as well go and drink.

Now, try writing down one or more examples of your black-or-white thoughts and
the red flag thoughts they can lead to.

DISCOUNTING THE POSITIVE

Picture yourself wearing a pair of glasses with a screen in place of the lens. You
filter your interpretations of experiences, situations, and the ways that people interact
with you through this screen. The screen keeps all of the positive thoughts about
your experiences on the outside, letting only the negative thoughts come through.
This is the case even when good things happen. For example, if Scott’s boss gives him
a compliment on something he did well at work, and he’s “discounting the positive,”
he might have a thought like, He didn’t mean that. He just feels sorry for me because I keep
on screwing up. He said that out of pity. By discounting the positive, Scott is casting aside
all of the ways that this compliment might be reassuring. Below is an example of how
discounting the positive can lead to a red flag thought.

Discounting the Positive Red Flag Thought

My boss only said something nice to me out — | I’m pathetic. I have nothing to lose by

count the positive. Then, write down the red flag thoughts they can lead to.

Step 3: Become a “Self Expert”

JUMPING TO CONCLUSIONS

If you tend to jump to conclusions, you are doing one of two things: You are either
mind reading or fortune telling. If you are a mind reader, then you assume that other
people’s behavior toward you reflects something negative about how they feel about
you. You make these interpretations with very little or no factual information. For
example, if you are with a friend who is not being especially talkative, rather than
assuming that your friend might be having a bad day, or might have something on her
mind, you think, She’s not talking to me because she doesn’t like me. That is one form of
jumping to conclusions.

If you fall into a habit of fortune telling, then you predict that things will turn out
badly for you. The way you see things, there is doom and gloom waiting for you
around the corner; that is your ultimate fate. Scott did some fortune telling after his
boss gave him the negative feedback; he predicted that he would get fired, even
though his boss did not say that he was on the road to losing his job. Although getting
written up at work obviously isn’t a positive, it is also not a sure path to getting fired.
When you are fortune telling, you go straight to the worst-case scenario without con-
sidering the other possible outcomes.

Let’s look at a couple of examples of how jumping to conclusions can bring on red
flag thoughts. You'll notice that in the first example below, the red flag thought is one
that is triggered by interpersonal conflict; sometimes you may feel like retaliating
against someone who has upset you, by drinking or using. Make a mental note of it
or write down an example in the exercise below if this is a pattern of thinking you
have experienced before. In steps 4 through 7, you will learn how to cope with inter-
personal conflict in a healthier way.

Jumping to Conclusions Red Flag Thought

My brother is blowing me off because he I'll show him! If he’s going to treat me like
thinks he’s better than me. (Mind reading) | that, I’m going to go use.

With my luck, treatment won't work for me. | I'll never be able to stay clean and sober.
(Fortune telling) There’s no point in even trying.

Now, try writing down one or more examples of ways that you have engaged in
jumping to conclusions, and the red flag thoughts that are connected.

My ways of jumping to conclusions (mind reading or fortune telling):

Red flag thoughts:

TAKING YOUR FEELINGS TOO SERIOUSLY

When you take your feelings too seriously, it means that you think of your feel-
ings as reality. Even though your feelings are real, they can lead you to some unreal-
istic conclusions if you take them too seriously. For example, if you feel depressed you
may draw the conclusion that you can’t enjoy anything. Although your depressed
feeling is real, if you were to get out and try to do something enjoyable, chances are
it would help you get out of that mood.

Here’s another example: Scott felt worthless at work after his boss spoke with him
about his need for improvement. Just because he felt worthless, it doesn’t mean that
he is worthless. It is hard to separate an intense feeling from reality during the
moment, but the fact is that just because you feel a certain way, it doesn’t mean that
you are that way. Let’s look at an example of how taking your feelings too seriously
can lead to a red flag thought.

SELF-BLAME

If you tend to be hard on yourself, and have an active self-critical voice inside of
you, then you probably can relate to this mistake in thinking. You blame yourself for
things that may not be in your control. Your addiction is a perfect example. Do you
ever blame yourself for it? Remember, even if you have made bad choices during your
fight with addiction, becoming an addict was not your choice; nor was it your fault.
You developed a brain disease, and you are working very hard to overcome it and put
your rational mind back in control. Let’s look at an example of how self-blame can
lead to a red flag thought.

Self-Blaming Thought Red Flag Thought

It’s all my fault that I drink too much. I’ve ruined my life; I have nothing to lose by
continuing to drink.

LABELING YOURSELF

Labeling yourself is a close relative to taking your feelings too seriously. I
feel ; therefore I must be . You label yourself for the ways
that you feel, or for the mistakes that you’ve made. For example, if you are feeling
down, you might think, I’m a depressing person; I’m such a downer for everybody. Instead
of thinking of yourself as a person who happens to be in a depressed mood, you label
yourself for it. Another example: if you make a mistake, you might label yourself as a
“loser,” rather than a person who happened to make a mistake. Let’s look at an
example of how labeling can lead to a red flag thought.

ing and the red flag thoughts that it can lead to.

The Spiraling Lapse

If you're like most people who struggle with addictions, then you've probably made
more than one attempt to cut back or stop drinking or using. Think about the last
time that you tried, unsuccessfully, to stop drinking or using. Did you know that the
first time you drank or used after days, weeks, or months of abstinence was not a
relapse? That very first time that you drink or use after a period of going without is
called a slip or a lapse. What you probably don’t know is that, when you lapse, the way
that you talk to yourself about it can determine whether or not you will continue
drinking or using. When you keep the lapse going, it turns into a relapse.

Research has shown that it is very common to think about lapses in ways that
keep you on the path to relapse, rather than recovery (Marlatt and Gordon 1985).
Although it’s true that a lapse places you at risk for a relapse, the relapse is not inevi-
table. You have more control than you might think over the outcome. To prevent a
lapse from converting into a full-blown relapse, you need to avoid the mistake called
the spiraling lapse. The spiraling lapse is when you interpret a lapse as being the result
of one of two things:

1. You see yourself as a personal failure. People who interpret a lapse as a per-
sonal failure tend to feel very guilty or ashamed, and the desire to avoid or
numb those feelings can very easily lead to more drinking or using.

101


The Addiction Recovery Skills Workbook

2. You view the lapse as being the result of things that are completely beyond
your control. People who think of themselves as having no control over
their addiction or their addictive behavior tend to give up on attempts to
quit.

Here are some of the thoughts that you might have had if you've experienced the
spiraling lapse:

© One lapse means I'm a total failure.

* I’ve blown everything now! I might as well keep drinking (or using).
* Iam hopeless.

© Once a drunk (or addict), always a drunk (or addict).

¢ I'll never get back to being straight again.

* I’ve screwed up today already, I might as well go all out!

* Ihave no willpower... I've lost all control.

¢ I’m just addicted to this stuff. I always will be.

Can you think of any other thoughts you've had that are along these lines? The
thoughts you'll want to identify are the ones that you tell yourself that make it more
likely that you'll continue to drink or use after you've lapsed. If you can think of any
that are not listed above, write them in the space provided:

102


Step 3: Become a “Self Expert”

Obviously, it would be best if you would get it perfectly the first time around, and
never slip or lapse. But research demonstrates that relapse rates for people with addic-
tions are similar to those for people with other chronic diseases, such as diabetes,
hypertension, and asthma, occurring in 40 percent to 60 percent of those who receive
treatment (McLellan 2000). What this really means is that a lapse or a relapse is not
a sign that treatment has failed. In CBT, lapses or relapses are viewed as a sign that
more treatment is needed, or that an adjustment to the treatment approach should be
considered. Changes can include introducing different therapy techniques, introduc-
ing or adjusting a medication, or changing the therapy modality (such as shifting
from weekly therapy to a more intensive type of program).

When it comes to the spiraling lapse, the adjustment you need may be as simple
as changing your thinking about a lapse. Rather than interpreting it as a sign of
failure, or the beginning of a downward spiral into relapse and loss of control, you can
realize that, in the situation that triggered the lapse, you didn’t cope very well. If you
think of it that way, you will see that the lapse is a learning opportunity. You don’t
have to spiral into a full-blown relapse; it is not inevitable. If you talk about it with
your counselor or therapist, and complete the exercises you'll find in the next chapter
(“Step 4: Respond to Cognitive Distortions”), you can learn from your mistakes and
find healthier ways to cope with similar triggering situations in the future.

Cravings

You are learning a lot about how the sequence from trigger to drug or alcohol use unfolds
for you, now that you've come to understand your triggers and the thoughts they lead
to. Next, we turn to the craving phase, which is the last experience in the sequence
prior to making a decision about drinking or using. When you break the process
down, and become aware of the triggers, thoughts, and cravings, then the final
outcome of it (drinking or using—or not) does not have to be automatic. It becomes a
decision that you can make with your rational brain.

Noticing all of the sensations, thoughts, and emotions that you experience during
cravings is a central part of becoming a self expert. Cravings are different for every-
one. The first step to beating a craving is taking a look at each of the features of the
craving and understanding how you experience it. In this next exercise, you will iden-
tify how you experience cravings in your mind and body.

103


The Addiction Recovery Skills Workbook

Exercise 5.3: How Do You Experience Cravings?

Think about the last time you had an intense craving. Now, for this first part of the exercise,
try and think about where you were feeling it in your body. Put a check next to the areas or
sensations below that best describe your experience.

Chest (tightness or other sensation)

Stomach

Jaw

Neck

Shoulders

Heart (racing)

Nose (feeling like you could smell what you were craving)

Other areas or sensations:

Now, try and think about the emotions you experience during a craving. Check the emo-
tions below that best describe your experience. Add any that are not listed in the space pro-
vided at the end.

Anxiety
Excitement
Anticipation
Restlessness

Irritability

Finally, let’s identify the cognitive (thoughts) part of your experience. Below are some
common thoughts that accompany cravings. If thoughts are a noticeable part of your experi-
ence during a craving, then place a mark next to the ones that you've experienced.

In the next chapter, you will learn a whole new set of skills for coping with crav-
ings. Your job right now is simply to notice everything about them.

CBT Self-Monitoring Skills

One important set of skills taught in CBT that is central to becoming a self expert is
self-monitoring skills. Learning to self-monitor can help you to understand the psychol-
ogy behind your addiction and begin to control it. By monitoring your experiences

105


The Addiction Recovery Skills Workbook

throughout each day, you become aware of your thoughts and emotions, and the
behaviors that they are linked with, as they happen. Since most of us are not used to
“thinking about thinking’—sometimes referred to as metacognitive skills (Dobson
2013)—it can be a little bit challenging at first, especially since our thoughts often go
through our heads so rapidly that we don’t notice them right way. But with practice,
you can learn to become more self-aware, and once you do, you can start building a
repertoire of CBT and other skills that you can use to change your thinking and
behavior patterns in ways that support your recovery.

Exercise 5.4 provides you with a craving self-monitoring form. Using this form,
you will identify your triggers, thoughts, emotions, and the intensity of your cravings.
In the first column, write down the date and time of day. Next, you'll identify the
situation you were in when you felt triggered. For example, did you experience an
internal trigger (such as feeling depressed after an argument with your partner) or an
external trigger (such as attending a party where other people were drinking or using
in front of you)? Next, you will write down the thoughts that went through your
mind when you were triggered and the feelings that came up for you in conjunction
with your thoughts. Finally, you will rate the intensity of your craving on a scale from
0 to 10, with 0 being no cravings at all, 5 being an average number (meaning that you
had some cravings but they were not constant or difficult to cope with) and 10 being
severe, constant cravings.

It would be helpful for you to make copies of the cravings rating form and com-
plete it daily. (You can download the form at the website for this book, http:/;vww
-newharbinger.com/32783.) Try to fill it out in “real time” whenever you can, so that
the details about your thoughts and the intensity of your cravings are as accurate as
possible. By self-monitoring regularly, you may start to identify triggers and thought
patterns that you weren't previously aware of that lead to cravings. By raising your
awareness of your psychological experience as it relates to your addiction, you are
gaining the knowledge and self-understanding that you need to be a self expert.

Wrap-up

Congratulations! You've made it through an intense set of exercises, and you are well
on your way to changing your addictive behaviors. Now that you have intimate
knowledge of your triggers, thoughts, and cravings, you are well positioned to learn
to respond differently to the cues that used to lead you straight down a path to drink-
ing or using. Remember to use the self-monitoring form regularly and complete all of
the exercises in this chapter so that you can refer back to them as you begin practic-
ing new coping skills. Beginning in the next chapter, you are going to develop a rep-
ertoire of skills to cope with your triggers, thoughts, and cravings without turning to
alcohol or drugs.

108


CHAPTER 6

Step 4: Respond to
Cognitive Distortions

of “red flag thoughts” that enter your mind when you find yourself exposed to a
trigger, and some of the errors in thinking that you are prone to making when
you are tempted to drink or use. Now that you have a really thorough understanding

I n the last chapter, you took a very close look at your triggers, the different types

of how triggers convert into cravings or urges, it’s time to start developing a repertoire
of coping skills that will enable you to get through those urges without turning to
alcohol or drugs.

Just like it sounds, cognitive behavioral therapy has both cognitive and behavioral
skills components. So, when you find yourself triggered or tempted to drink or use,
you have two “go-to” sets of therapeutic strategies that you can choose from. In this
chapter, you will learn to use both of these types of skills to cope with the distorted
thoughts that you experience when you are triggered. As you practice these new skills,
pay special attention to which ones are the most useful to you, as well as which ones
don’t work quite as well. From this chapter forward, based on your own observations
and reflections about your experiences trying out these different techniques, you will
start forming your individualized relapse prevention plan.

Outsmarting Your Addicted Brain

We've talked about your addicted brain and how the exercises in this workbook will
help you “defeat it” by making your rational brain stronger. That’s what the cognitive
part of CBT is all about. The red flag thoughts you identified in chapter 5 are the


The Addiction Recovery Skills Workbook

byproducts of your addicted brain. This is the part of you that finds ways of

justify-

ing a relapse to feed those uncomfortable urges. With practice, you can challenge
these thoughts successfully and “outsmart” your lower, addicted brain. When you do

that repeatedly, your rational mindset will start to become the new normal
and you can begin to break free from the thoughts that have been interferi
the goals you've set for your recovery.

Thought Challenging

for you,
ng with

As you learn to outsmart your addicted brain, the most powerful cognitive tech-

nique you will use is the skill of thought challenging. As you practice this me
transforming irrational thinking into balanced, realistic thoughts, you will

‘thod of
learn to

take a scientific approach to correcting the thoughts that are leading you down a path

to self-destructive behaviors, like drinking and using drugs.
One of the most important things you will get out of learning CBT tec
like thought challenging is something that applies not only to overcoming ad

niques
diction,

but also to coping with other problems that stem from irrational thoughts (like

depression, anxiety, and other emotional difficulties). You will learn to und

erstand

and change your behavior by being scientific, and sticking to the facts. What does that
mean, exactly? you might be wondering. How can I be “scientific”? It’s not as complicated

as it might sound, actually. You can achieve this by learning to notice and res;
your thoughts in several ways.

pond to

1. First, to become scientific, you need to practice observing yourself. You are
already making headway toward becoming an objective observer of your

experience, having begun to monitor your thoughts and cravings, and i
tify your mistakes in thinking.

iden-

2. Next, you'll need to practice questioning whether your thoughts are rational—
especially the ones that relate to drinking or using drugs. Thought chal-

lenging is the process of questioning your thoughts about drinking
using by asking yourself if you have evidence that they are true.

3. Finally, after you question the evidence for your thoughts, if you find
you don’t have evidence to support what you are thinking, then you
identify more rational, evidence-based ideas that you can tell you

and

that
will
rself

instead. These new, healthy and balanced thoughts will help you make the

behavior changes you set out to accomplish in your recovery plan.

110


Step 4: Respond to Cognitive Distortions

To put the thought challenging process into action, you're going to need a frame-
work. First, we'll take a look at a few examples of how to challenge common red flag
thoughts. Once you get the hang of it, you can complete the worksheet using your
own examples. This worksheet can be used to review patterns of thinking that have
led you to drink or use in the past. And if you slip or relapse at any time in the future,
the exercises can help you (and your treatment provider, if you have one) to under-
stand how the relapse unfolded and what you can do differently going forward.

Scott Gets Triggered

Scott has a strong urge to drink a glass of wine. On a scale from 0 to 10, he rates
his craving as a 7. He thinks about it and realizes that it is because he is at a party
with some friends he used to drink with.

Scott can try thought challenging by following three steps, which we will call
the three T’s: identifying the triggering situation, and the red flag thoughts about
drinking or using that followed, and placing the thoughts on trial:

Triggering situation: Hanging out with drinking buddies at a party
Red flag thoughts: If I have just one drink, it’s no big deal. I can control it.

Thoughts on trial: Scott puts his thoughts on trial by examining the evidence for
them. Below you will find the questions he asks to figure out whether his
addicted brain is driving the thoughts or if they are rational, and the honest
answers he comes up with.

Questions to Ask to Examine The Facts
the Evidence

Is one drink okay? Yes. Having one drink is not destructive.

Can I control my drinking enough to stop _ | It’s been too long to even remember the
after one drink? last time I stopped after one drink. The
likelihood of that is extremely low.

111


The Addiction Recovery Skills Workbook

Result: Now that Scott has used the three T’s to challenge his thoughts, it’s
time for him to take a look at the result, and take action accordingly. In this
example, as a result of the thought challenging exercise, Scott can see that his
thought about having one drink was irrational. Although it is true that one
drink is not harmful to most people, when he takes an honest look at his past
patterns of behavior, he can recognize that there is no good evidence that he can
control his drinking in the way that he wishes to. Even though he might be able
to have one drink from time to time, before long it would likely lead him back
to his older patterns of drinking heavily. The idea that he could have “just one
drink” is exactly the kind of thought that the addicted brain produces to feed
the urge to drink.

Response: Okay, so Scott had an irrational thought. We all experience irrational
thoughts, whether they are about drinking or something else. The important
question that follows is, how can you respond to it? When you respond, your
goal is to get your mind back on track, to line it back up with your recovery—
and of course, with reality! To do this, Scott can respond by telling himself the
following:

¢ For me, one drink is a big deal. In the past, this way of thinking has led me straight
to a full-blown relapse.

° There is plenty of evidence that I practically never stop after one drink, and I am not
able to control myself once I start drinking.

Lucy Gets Triggered

Lucy has a strong urge to use cocaine. On a scale from 0 to 10, she rates her craving
as an 8. She thinks about it and realizes that it is because she is feeling depressed
and low in energy, and she’s looking for something to “pick her up.”

Lucy tries thought challenging, using the three T’s:

Triggering situation: Feeling depressed and low in energy

Red flag thoughts: Cocaine is the only thing that will make me feel better. It will help
me get stuff done.

112


Step 4: Respond to Cognitive Distortions

Thoughts on trial: Lucy puts her thoughts on trial as she examines the evidence

for them:

Questions to Ask to Examine
the Evidence

The Facts

Will cocaine make me feel better?

At first, yes, it will. But when it wears off,
I will be even more depressed, and I will feel
bad about having caved in and used.

Is cocaine the only thing that will make
me feel better?

Probably not. There are healthier things
that could make me feel better—like talking
to someone, or exercising, or doing
something fun.

Will cocaine help me get stuff done?

At first, yes, I will have more energy to get
stuff done. But there are only so many
things I can do well if I'm high. And then
when I crash afterward, I might not get
anything done for days.

Result: Now that Lucy has used the three T’s to challenge her thoughts, she can
see that her thoughts about using cocaine to feel better and get things done was

irrational. Although there is some superficial truth to the idea that using cocaine
could lift her mood in the moment, and help her to get some extra energy, when

she takes a more thorough and honest look at the evidence, she realizes that the

longer-term impact of using, over the days and hours that follow, would counter-
act all of the positives that would come of it.

Response: To get herself back into her recovering mindset, Lucy can respond by

telling herself the following:

* Cocaine makes my depression worse, not better. Even though I might feel good for a
short time, using always makes me more depressed once it’s over.

¢ There is plenty of evidence that when I use, I am less productive. I get depressed and

barely do anything for days afterward.

113



The Addiction Recovery Skills Workbook

* Just because I get more energy for a short time doesn’t mean that using is going to lead

me to get a lot of stuff done.

Brian Gets Triggered

Brian has a craving to use marijuana. On a scale from 0 to 10, he rates his craving
as a 7. Upon reflection, he realizes that it’s because he is nervous about going to a
party by himself, and he’d like to smoke some pot to take the edge off.

Brian tries thought challenging, using the three T’s:

Triggering situation: Going to a party alone and feeling some social anxiety
about it

Red flag thoughts: Jf I’m high, I won't feel so self-conscious and it won't be as hard to
talk to people.

Thoughts on trial: Brian puts his thoughts on trial as he examines the evidence
that marijuana will help him feel and socialize better at the party.

Questions to Ask to Examine
the Evidence

The Facts

Will marijuana take the edge off and make
me feel better?

At first, yes, it will. But when it wears off,
my mood will be down, and I won't feel so
great for a day or two.

Will being high help me handle myself
better at the party?

Not entirely. I won't feel as self-conscious,
so it will be easier to be there alone. But
usually when I am high I'm a little
distant and I don’t really connect well
with new people.

Is it worth it to use marijuana in this
situation?

It will make me feel better in the moment,
but I probably won't socialize very much
at the party. And because of the effect it
will have on my mood and energy
afterward, it’s not worth it.

114



Step 4: Respond to Cognitive Distortions

Result: Now that Brian has used the three T’s to take a closer look at his
thoughts about using marijuana to cope with his anxiety, he can see that, on
balance, his thoughts were irrational. Although there is some superficial truth to
the idea that getting high can reduce his social anxiety, when he takes an honest
survey of the evidence, he concludes that the negative effects of smoking mari-
juana outweigh the benefits. He asks himself an important question to conclude
his thought challenging exercise: Is it worth it to use in this situation? This is a
question that you can use to make a decision about what to do when the results
of your thought challenging are not crystal clear. In Brian’s case, marijuana use
has some beneficial effects on his social anxiety, so balancing the positive and
negative outcomes of using was a helpful way of making a rational decision.

Response: To weigh the evidence for his decision about marijuana use more
rationally, Brian can respond by telling himself the following:

* Getting high makes me a little awkward and distant in social situations. Even though
I might feel less self-conscious, I won't really connect with anyone at the party. In that
case, there’s not much point in going if I have to get high to get myself there.

° There is plenty of evidence that when I use, it affects my mood negatively and I don’t
function so well for a day or two.

* Just because I won't feel so self-conscious doesn’t mean that using is worth it.

Superficial Truths: Watch Out for Them!

You might have noticed that in both Brian and Lucy’s examples, they were tempted
to use by certain thoughts that turned out to be superficial truths. That means that
some short-term benefit of drinking or using gives the decision to slip or relapse some
major appeal. This can get somewhat confusing—because it is a rational element of
your thought process about drinking and using. It does feel good at first. That’s true.
It can relieve anxiety in the short-term. That's true. If you really think about it, you
will find that it makes sense that there are some positive effects that drinking or using
drugs has on you—otherwise you wouldn't have found yourself doing more of it in
the first place!

115


The Addiction Recovery Skills Workbook

The key is to consider those positives in the bigger context of why you're trying to
quit. Yes, it feels good at first in certain situations, but ten what happens? What is it
about the sequence that starts with feeling good that led you to pick up this book and
work so hard to stop? One of the goals of thought challenging is to be able to recog-
nize when you are allowing yourself to be persuaded to make choices about drinking
or using by superficial truths, and challenge them.

Responding to the Most Common
Thought Errors

In chapter 5, you learned about different kinds of mistakes in thinking that can lead
to red flag thoughts. Before you continue to practice thought challenging using the
errors in thinking that you wrote down on the Thought Challenging Worksheet, take
a look at the table that follows for some suggestions about how to respond to the most
common mistakes in thinking. Remember, the first thing to do once you recognize
that you've made one of the thought errors below is to make yourself aware of it by
starting an internal dialogue about what just happened. (Okay, wait a minute. I'm start-
ing to do that black-or-white thinking again...) Then, once you have become aware of it,
you can use the three T’s and respond to your thought error using the kinds of
thoughts or responses you see in the right hand column of the table below.

follows (also available at http:/www.newharbinger.com/32783) on a daily basis, any
time you get triggered. You can review your entries with your counselor or therapist
(if you have one) as part of your treatment.

Thinking vs. Doing

Some people can change their behavior by thinking their way through their irrational
brain’s ideas, challenging them, and converting them into healthy, rational thoughts.
Sometimes, and for some people, rather than correcting red flag thoughts using cogni-
tive techniques like thought challenging, it works better to change what they’re doing,
using behavioral coping strategies. There are a few reasons why that might be. For
some, it has to do with the timing in recovery. That is, in early recovery, when crav-
ings for alcohol and drugs can be very strong and emotions can be overwhelming, it
might be hard to concentrate or think clearly enough to have the inner dialogue that
thought challenging requires. For others, it’s just a general preference for getting out
of their own head. They may find it an easier way of preventing relapse than using a
cognitive strategy.

Surf the Urge

The average length of a craving is about fifteen minutes. Even though that can feel
like a lifetime when you're so uncomfortable physically and emotionally, you might
find it helpful to keep it in perspective and remember that it will end! For some
people, it’s useful to imagine the craving as a wave in the ocean—it will climb until
it peaks, and then it will crash and subside. If you can get through that brief period
of time by riding it out, the discomfort will pass, and your recovery will grow stron-
ger. As you are riding the urge out, you will experience the urge sensations weakening
and going away. The goal is to ride it out without reacting to it by drinking or using.
You will learn more about how to use similar techniques to this one in the next
chapter, on becoming mindful.

Distract Yourself

Have you ever noticed, when you experience an urge to drink or use, that the
longer you spend thinking about it, the harder it is to resist it? This is a very common
experience, so if you've had it, you are not alone. In a way, thinking about drinking
or using is like entertaining a fantasy, and the more invested you are in imagining
how it will play out, the more you want it. The more you want it, the less you are able
to weigh the pros and cons and make a rational decision about it. With this knowl-
edge, you can choose to distract yourself from the urge before your imagination runs
away with it and leads you to a relapse. Here are some ways that you can distract

yourself early on, when you first notice the urge:

122

Imagine a big, red STOP sign as soon as you feel the urge. Hold that image
in your mind for as long as you can.

Wear a rubber band around your wrist. If you feel an urge, snap it just to
distract your attention from it.

If you can, leave the situation that triggered the urge.
Go for a walk or engage in another form of exercise.

Find a distracting activity that can hold your attention for fifteen or twenty
minutes, whether it’s writing, reading, going somewhere that feels safe, or
calling someone.

Meditate or use other relaxation exercises. (You will learn more about how
to do this in the next chapter.)

Pray.

Go to a 12-step or other self-help meeting. You can download an app, such
as The Meeting Finder, onto your phone that will locate the closest meeting
to you at any time.

Talk to somebody who supports your recovery. This can be a friend, thera-
pist, 12-step sponsor, or family member. Just talking to somebody can help
you get through a tough moment, whether you talk about the urge or
craving itself or a completely different topic.


Step 4: Respond to Cognitive Distortions

¢ Use imagery to get your mind to a different place. You can try imagining a
safe, quiet place, or a place that you would love to be in that moment. Just
be sure that the place you choose is not compatible with drinking or using.

Start experimenting with these distraction techniques and see what works for
you. We'll put them into your personalized relapse prevention plan later. If you think
of some distracting activities not listed here that are helpful to you, list them here:

Delay the Decision

Now that you have some ideas about how to distract yourself from an urge or
craving, you can use these distractions to delay the decision about whether or not to
drink or use for at least fifteen or twenty minutes. This can be a very useful way to
fight off the impulse to give in to an urge, which usually lasts only fifteen or twenty
minutes. You'll find, more often than not, that once you’ve made it through that
initial period of time and the urge has subsided, it is easier to make a firm commit-
ment to not drink or use. If you are still uncertain after fifteen or twenty minutes,
repeat the exercise: distract yourself and delay the decision for another fifteen or
twenty minutes.

Keep a Schedule

Although red flag thoughts and cravings are very common, especially when you
first quit or cut back on drinking or using drugs, there are ways that you can prevent
them from coming on in the first place. When you became a self expert in chapter 5,
you learned how to identify your triggers. One way to build on this skill is to schedule

123


The Addiction Recovery Skills Workbook

how you will spend your days in advance, so you can anticipate when you might find
yourself in a triggering situation, and plan for it. Consider an example:

Scott’s schedule for Monday is as follows:

7:00 a.m.: Wake up; eat breakfast

8:00 a.m.: Take kids to school

9:00 a.m.: Arrive at work

11:30 a.m.: Meeting with boss**

12:00 p.m.: Lunch hour**

5:00 p.m.: Leave work

6:00 p.m.: Make dinner

6:30-7:30 p.m.: Dinner, winding down the evening

7:30-9:30 p.m.: Free time (kids asleep)**

9:30 p.m.—bedtime: Wife gets home from work; spend time together

**High-risk or triggering situations

By writing out his schedule, Scott identified three potential
tions: First, he has been having some difficulties at work, and he

ly triggering situa-
gets very stressed

when he meets with his boss, which has triggered cravings and urges for him in the

past. His meeting with his boss on Monday is just before lunch
doesn’t have any lunch meetings, Scott might be tempted to go out
a glass of wine with his meal—lunch hour was often the time wh
drink of the day. Another risky time for him is when he is alone
kids to bed at 7:30, he can anticipate experiencing an urge to drin
his wife to get home from her late shift at work.

our, and since he
for lunch and have
en he had his first
. After putting his
k while waiting for

Scott will need to plan out what he will do at each of these ris!

ky times. The key,

however, is that he was able to identify them in advance because he wrote out his

schedule. Finding an effective coping strategy is easiest to do when

you've planned for

it. To practice this, use the daily schedule that follows. Once we’ve reviewed some
more behavioral coping skills that you can use during these risky times, you will start

using the Urge Planner (exercise 6.5) to plan ahead for them.

124


Step 4: Respond to Cognitive Distortions

Exercise 6.4: Daily Schedule

When you complete your daily schedule, try to fill in as much as you can, including what time
you wake up, shower, eat, exercise, and work; any appointments you have; social or family
plans; errands; and anything else you are able to think of. As you begin to keep a detailed
schedule, notice which planned activities might be triggering for you and place asterisks (**)
next to them. It will also help to pay attention to blocks of time in your day when you might not
have anything planned; these, for some people, are vulnerable times when cravings or urges
often come up. By noticing and paying special attention to these high-risk times, you can start
to structure your time more, as needed, with activities that are not compatible with drinking or
using (for example, going to a 12-step or other recovery-oriented meeting, or spending time
with a sober friend or loved one).

Planning for High-Risk Situations

A high-risk situation is any situation that might be triggering for you. While scheduling
your time can help you to avoid high-risk situations, some are unavoidable—for
example, stressful interactions with coworkers or family members, obligatory work
functions where others might be drinking, or any experience that brings up unpleas-
ant emotions. Like Scott, you can plan for upcoming high-risk situations by thinking
ahead of time about how you can handle them.

126


Step 4: Respond to Cognitive Distortions

Let’s take one of Scott’s anticipated urges as an example. Scott has a meeting
scheduled with his boss just before his lunch hour. Those meetings are always stress-
ful, and Scott anticipates that he will be tempted to go out to lunch by himself after-
ward and drink a glass of wine.

To be ready to cope with this situation, Scott needs to have at least two ideas: a
plan and a backup plan. These are the plans he comes up with:

Plan: Make lunch plans with a friend from work, Bianca, whom I wouldn’t
drink with during work hours.

Backup plan: Bring lunch to eat at my desk, and schedule a call with my AA
sponsor for that time, so he can help me if I’m feeling triggered.

Now it’s your turn to use the Urge Planner for any high-risk situations you might
have identified in your schedule for the upcoming week.

Are you someone who gets more out of cognitive strategies than behavioral ones,
or vice versa? Are both types of skills helpful to you? Does it depend on the situation?
As you are developing your personal relapse prevention plan, you'll want to ask your-
self these questions. If this workbook is your first exposure to CBT, then you are still
in the process of gathering evidence to answer those questions. As you continue your
cognitive and behavioral coping skills practice, give some thought to which ones work
for you best, so that you can emphasize them when you make your relapse prevention
plan in chapter 10.

Wrap-up

In this chapter, you've started to form a repertoire of skills to cope with your triggers,
thoughts, and cravings without turning to alcohol or drugs. You've learned cognitive

128


Step 4: Respond to Cognitive Distortions

skills, such as identifying red flag thoughts and superficial truths and challenging
them. You've also been practicing behavioral skills, which include distracting yourself
and keeping a schedule. The best way for you to begin to develop a relapse prevention
plan that works for you is to continue to practice these techniques week after week
(including making use of the Urge Planner, the daily schedule, and the thought chal-
lenging form), and make notes in your workbook about the ones that you have found
to be the most helpful.

All of these skills require practice before using them will come naturally to you in
a risky situation, so the more you work on them, the better. And don’t be too hard on
yourself if it doesn’t always occur to you to use them. Just as it took a while for your
use of alcohol or drugs to form an addiction, it will also take some time for you to
learn new ways of responding to your urges to drink or use. Be patient with
yourself.

In the next chapter, you will learn a different, equally useful approach to dealing
with uncomfortable cravings or urges: rather than trying to change your thoughts or
distract yourself from them, you are going to practice accepting and exploring them.

The purpose of this chapter is to give you a basic understanding of what mindful-
ness is, to show you how mindfulness techniques and meditation can be helpful to

you in your recovery, and to give you some
ize yourself with how to use them.

What Is Mindfulness?

Mindfulness, one of the most widely used

practice exercises so that you can familiar-

and studied forms of meditation, was first

introduced to Western psychology by Dr. Jon Kabat-Zinn at the University of
Massachusetts Medical School (Kabat-Zinn 1990). He developed an eight-week


The Addiction Recovery Skills Workbook

program called mindfulness-based stress reduction, originally to help people with
chronic pain; from there, the treatment was extended to individuals suffering from
anxiety and depression (Kabat-Zinn et al. 1992; Roemer and Orsillo 2003; Ramel et
al. 2004; Evans et al. 2008) and cancer (Carlson et al. 2004), and finally to normal,
healthy adults struggling with stress (Astin 1997; Shapiro, Schwartz, and Bonner

1998; Williams et al. 2001).

If you're not experienced with meditation, you are probably wondering what
mindfulness is, exactly. Mindfulness is defined as “awareness that emerges through
paying attention, on purpose, in the present moment, and non-judgmentally to the
unfolding of experience, moment by moment.” (Kabat-Zinn 2003, 145). Let’s take a

look at what that means:

¢ Awareness: We all have habits or ways of behaving that we’ve been doing the

132

same way for so long that we don’t even notice when they are happening.
Drinking or using in response to certain triggers (like stress or negative
feelings) can be one of those habits. When you learn to be mindful, you
become aware of the sequence of experiences you have that lead you to
drink or use, before it actually happens. There are many parts of your expe-
rience that you can learn to be aware of, including the physical sensations
throughout your body, your breathing, your thoughts, your intentions, and
your emotions.

...that emerges through paying attention, on purpose, in the present moment: Our
attention naturally wanders from one thing to another. We are often dis-
tracted from something we are paying attention to by our own thoughts or
feelings or things that are happening in our environment. One of the ways
to learn to be aware of our experience in the here and now is to become
purposefully attentive to it. That often means recognizing when something
has distracted us, and purposely redirecting our attention to the here and
now experience. In recovery, paying attention, on purpose, to the experi-
ence of a craving or a negative feeling can help you to learn more about
yourself and your addiction, and to find your way through the craving or
negative emotion without trying to run away from it by drinking or using.

...nonjudgmentally: Whatever our experience is, we are used to labeling
things. Do you ever find yourself saying to yourself when you feel upset,


Step 5: Become Mindful

something like, I shouldn't feel upset? If so, you are not the only one who does
that; it’s what minds naturally do. We often judge our experience; we label
it as good or bad, justified or unjustified, given the circumstances. When
you experience an urge to drink or use, maybe you judge it, feel guilty
about it, or wish that it weren’t there. It comes very naturally—partly as a
way of making sense of our experience and our world—to label, evaluate,
or otherwise judge what we feel. When you practice mindfulness, you
reserve those judgments, accepting each aspect of your experience just the
way it is. An important part of this is bringing a gentle kindness to your
experience, as a way of showing compassion to yourself. As you probably
already know, recovery has a lot of uncomfortable moments. Paying atten-
tion to those moments on purpose, with compassion and without judging
yourself for them, is one powerful way to find your way through them.

* _...to the unfolding of experience, moment by moment: Our experiences are all tem-
porary. Feelings change, thoughts come in and out of our minds, and physi-
cal sensations come and go. We can’t predict how our experiences are going
to change from one moment to the next, but when practicing mindfulness,
we can observe the way our thoughts, emotions, and bodily sensations
unfold, and learn about them with open curiosity. As you get better at
becoming an observer of your experience without reacting to it in the moment,
you will gain better control over the way that you cope with difficult
experiences.

Why Mindfulness?

Now that you have a good sense of what mindfulness is, you are probably wondering
how it can be useful for addiction. It is only in very recent years that this approach
has been adapted specifically to help people with addictions, based on several known
facts about mindfulness and drug and alcohol problems:

¢ Mindfulness is very helpful for managing stress, which is one of the most
common triggers for relapse to alcohol and drug use (Hanson 2002; Sinha
2007, 2008; Tate et al. 2008).

133


The Addiction Recovery Skills Workbook

¢ Heavy use of alcohol or drugs can cause damage to certain areas of the
brain that enable you to think of a healthy way to cope with stress when
you are confronted with it in the moment. These are areas of the brain that
help you think through possible ways to manage a problem or stressor, and
at the same time control your impulse to use unhealthy coping strategies
that will give you a “quick fix’—like drinking or using drugs (Sinha 2008).

¢ Mindfulness can help you retrain your brain to take a thoughtful approach
to respond to the stress, rather than reacting to it impulsively by using alcohol
or drugs, or engaging in other self-destructive behaviors.

* Studies show that practicing mindfulness helps relieve depression and
anxiety, which are two of the most common psychological symptoms that
are experienced by people with addictions (Glasner-Edwards et al. 2009;
Breslin, Zack, and McMain 2002; Marlatt, 1996). Like stress, these symp-
toms often lead to relapse, so by learning to manage them, you increase
your chances of long-term recovery. In fact, a recent study proved this
pattern exactly: adults with drug addiction who received mindfulness
training showed improvements in symptoms of depression and anxiety,
and learning mindfulness techniques for recovery was especially useful to
addicts with diagnosed depression and anxiety, in improving their sub-
stance use (Glasner-Edwards et al., forthcoming).

* Studies show that practicing mindfulness reduces cravings for alcohol and
drugs (Witkiewitz, Lustyk, and Bowen 2013) and is helpful to people who
are in recovery from addictions in preventing relapse (Bowen et al. 2014).

Getting Started: Being Present

When you get out of bed in the morning and start getting ready to begin your day, is
your mind in the present, or is it off somewhere else? Here’s an example of how you'd
know: When you're brushing your teeth in the morning, are you paying attention to
the way that the bristles feel as they circle around against your teeth, or the minty
sensation of the toothpaste in your mouth? Chances are, the answer is no. When you
brush your teeth, your mind is probably doing what minds naturally do—they plan

134


Step 5: Become Mindful

and anticipate what’s to come, and when they are not jumping into the future, they
are reviewing past experiences. So you might be thinking about the day ahead of you,
reminding yourself what time your first commitment starts, or planning how you are
going to approach a meeting or interaction you know you are going to have that day.
Maybe you're reviewing something that happened yesterday or last week, playing a
tape of it back in your mind.

This “mode” of doing things without being present as you do them, is called auto-
matic pilot (Bowen, Chawla, and Marlatt 2010). You can do a lot of things in automatic
pilot mode, especially things that you do every day. Certain elements of your daily
routine (like brushing your teeth, taking a shower, eating breakfast, or driving to
work or school) are so well rehearsed, that you don’t need to think about them as you
are doing them. Your mind feels free to wander, and it makes its way into the past or
the future. When you learn mindfulness skills, you purposely keep your mind in the
here and now, gently bringing it back to the present whenever it wanders off.

What does this have to do with addiction? you might be wondering. The concept of
automatic pilot is actually very relevant to addiction, and here’s how: Over time,
addictive behaviors become like habits. Have you ever found yourself drinking or
using without being completely aware of how or why you started? It’s something
you've probably done many times without really thinking about it, or without any
awareness that there were thoughts, emotions, and possibly physical sensations that
led up to it (Marlatt and Ostafin 2005). As you learn to become more connected to
your experience in the present, you can begin to make a shift from reacting automati-
cally and out of habit to your thoughts and feelings to making mindful choices about
your behavior (especially those that involve drugs and alcohol) with kindness and
self-compassion. These mindful choices about drinking and using become available
to you when you are tuned in and aware of your urges and cravings as they occur.

To begin to step out of automatic pilot, you are going to be introduced to a series
of exercises. When you practice the principles of mindfulness, try not to judge your-
self. If you are new to mindfulness or to meditation in general, the exercises may
seem a little awkward. You may find yourself wondering whether or not you're
doing them right. Remember that there is no right or wrong when you are practicing
mindfulness; you are simply learning to observe your experience. Whether the
experience feels good, bad, strange, or neutral, you will simply observe it, bringing
your mind gently and kindly back to it whenever it wanders (and it will, because all
minds do!). This is a skill that takes practice, so try to be patient. You'll get the
hang of it with time.

135


The Addiction Recovery Skills Workbook

Exercise 7.1: Observe Your Body

To become an observer of your experience, you will first need a little bit of practice with the
skill of observing. In this first exercise, you are going to practice observing your body, or your
physical self. Keep in mind that this exercise is not intended to make you feel a certain way;
it is not a relaxation exercise, but rather an exercise in observation. What you are practic-
ing here is becoming present and aware of your physical body, whether that feels relaxing,
neutral, or even uncomfortable. Just observe it, whatever it is.

Begin by sitting in a comfortable position, taking a moment to notice the movement of
your breath, the rising and the falling of your chest with each inhale and exhale. Stay with
your breath in this way for a minute. When you're ready, bring your awareness to the physical
sensations in your body, beginning with the sensations of your body making contact with your
chair, and your feet making contact with the ground. Just take a moment to observe how that
feels. If you're feeling restless, or distracted by thoughts, sounds, or things that you can see in
your environment, just congratulate yourself for noticing that your mind has wandered, and
gently bring yourself back to awareness of your body.

Now bring your awareness to your feet. Notice any sensations you have in your feet,
paying attention to their temperature, the way their contact with your shoes (if you’re wearing
any) feels, the sensations of the toes touching each other, and any sensations on the sole, top
of the foot, and ankle.

Moving away from the feet, bring your awareness to your legs. Use your awareness of
your legs to explore every sensation there, beginning with anything you feel in your calves,
your knees, and your thighs. Pay attention to the areas of your legs that make contact with
your chair, noticing the sensations there.

Now gently guide your awareness to your hips and waist. If you observe any pain or dis-
comfort, just practice being aware of it and letting it be as it is. Moving your awareness to
your back, begin with your lower back and bring your attention to any sensations there. Now
move to your upper back, paying attention to where your back makes contact with your chair.
Notice any tension or discomfort.

Next, guide your attention to your arms. Beginning at your hands and moving upward,
bring your awareness to any sensations you feel in your wrists, forearms, elbows, upper arms,
and finally, shoulders. Now focus your attention on your neck. Notice any tension there.
Moving up the neck, begin exploring the sensations on your face. Bring your attention to the
sensations you feel on your forehead, eyelids, eyebrows, nose, and cheeks.

Moving to your lips, bring your attention to your jaw and chin. Just notice any sensations
there. Then bring your awareness to the very top of your head. Now that you've explored the

136


Step 5: Become Mindful

sensations in the various parts of your body, just take a few moments to experience your body
as a whole, connecting again with your breath as you did when you began this exercise.
The intention behind doing exercises like this, that teach you to use mindful awareness when
paying attention to your body, is to help you learn the skill of being present. It sounds simple, but
it takes a tremendous amount of practice for most people to get comfortable with this. When
doing any mindfulness meditation practice, try and remember to approach it with these few
points in mind (which were reviewed earlier, but you are reminded of them here for emphasis):

¢ This exercise is not intended to help you relax or have a certain kind of new experience
within your body. Try to let go of any expectations about how this exercise will feel, and
just let it be whatever it is. Remember that the purpose of the exercise is to be present
and aware of whatever your experience is.

¢ If you get distracted, or you feel strange doing the exercise, or if you like or dislike it,
just notice those aspects of your experience and gently bring your attention back to
the exercise.

¢ Be open and curious about your experience, without judging or trying to change
it. Practice accepting your experience just the way that it is. You can even try telling
yourself, This is just the way things are right now. This can be helpful to you when you
are practicing the exercise itself or when you are using mindfulness in your daily life,
to cope with uncomfortable emotions, urges, cravings, or other experiences that you
may find stressful or difficult.

Living Mindfully

Daily life is full of opportunities to practice mindfulness, without a workbook in
front of you. Think about all of the things that you do automatically, without think-
ing. Take driving, for example. When you are driving your car, do you pay attention
to what your foot feels like when it makes contact with the gas pedal, or when it
shifts from the gas pedal to the brake? Are you aware of the coordination between
your hands on the steering wheel and the continuous movements of your feet, inte-
grating your mind’s intentions to head straight or turn right, and slow down or speed
up at the same time? If you're like most people, the answer to these questions is “no.”
When you're driving, you are probably planning what you are going to do when you
arrive at your destination, or what you'll be doing later that day. Maybe your mind
fast-forwards to the weekend, and what you have planned. Maybe you think about

137


The Addiction Recovery Skills Workbook

things that you are worried about. Or maybe you are talking on the phone as you
drive, and it’s that conversation that occupies your mind’s space.

Driving is just one example of things that we can do easily in automatic pilot
mode. Other things we do without being present include eating, bathing, washing our
hands, and walking. In this next exercise, you are going to try a few of these daily
activities with mindful awareness.

Exercise 7.2: Bringing Mindfulness Practice into
Your Daily Life

Practice being present and aware as you do each of the activities below. As you pay attention
to your experience, notice how your mind naturally wanders away from the activity and gently
bring it back to the present moment.

After you complete each exercise, ask yourself some questions about it: What did you
experience? What did you notice? Were there sensations (physical sensations, feelings, smells,
or other sensations) that you were not aware of before you approached the activity in this
way? What were they? Jot down some of your observations in the space provided after each
exercise.

Take a Mindful Shower

The mindful shower is a nice way to begin your day with awareness. This could set the tone
for your entire day, helping you to notice when you are in automatic pilot so that you can
purposely shift your attention to the present moment.

Begin by slowly setting your right foot into the shower, paying attention to the sensation of
your foot making contact with the floor. Transferring the weight of your body entirely to your
right foot and leg, notice, as you lift your left foot and move it forward to join your right foot
on the shower floor, the sensations in your left leg as it rises into the air, and in your left foot
as it makes contact with the floor. Notice your body’s stability in this standing position.

As you turn on the shower, move the dial slowly, paying attention to the way your hand
grasps the dial, and the intention with which it moves the dial to the position that turns it on
and adjusts it to your preference. Guide your attention to the sensations you feel on your skin
as the droplets of water make contact with it. Pay attention to the temperature of the water
and how the temperature of your skin changes as the water touches it.

Next, spend a few moments guiding your awareness to the sounds that you hear as the
water emerges from the showerhead and makes contact with your body. If you find that your

138


Step 5: Become Mindful

mind is wandering, worrying, planning, reviewing, or thinking about anything else, congratulate
yourself for noticing this and guide your awareness back to the present moment, in the shower.
Notice any smells. Maybe the soap has a familiar smell. Spend a few moments guiding
your attention to anything you can smell.
After you get out of the shower, see if you can continue your routine of getting ready with
this mindful approach. Then make some notes about your experience.

My observations during my mindful shower:

Eat Mindfully

In this exercise, you will pay attention to your experience of eating, moment by moment. Try
it with a piece of fruit—an apple, orange, or banana. When you try this for the first time,
remember that it will be just you having a few minutes with the fruit, so keep the television and
radio off, and try to minimize sources of distraction.

First, without holding it yet, take a look at the fruit as though you've never seen it before.
Notice its shape, its color, and any other features that you can see. Pay attention to whether
it needs to be peeled to be eaten. After you've taken in its appearance, pick up the fruit and
look at it more closely. Notice if your mind wanders or if you find yourself making any judg-
ments about the activity itself. When this happens, be kind to yourself, gently bringing your
attention back to the fruit.

Next, bring the fruit to your ear to see if it makes any sounds. Gently acknowledge any
impatience or other feelings that come up during the exercise, bringing your attention back
to the fruit each time. Now bring the fruit near to your nose, observing whether you are able
to smell it, and if so, how it smells—whether the smell is familiar, sweet, sour, or neutral.

As you prepare to take a bite, bring it slowly to your mouth, but before your mouth makes
contact, notice how it is preparing to receive the fruit. Notice whether saliva is forming and

139


The Addiction Recovery Skills Workbook

where on your tongue you can feel it. As you take a bite from the fruit, notice how it feels
resting inside of your mouth. Keep it there for a moment before you begin to chew it, notic-
ing how it feels, and what the sensations in your mouth are like, once the fruit is resting
inside of it. When you begin to chew it, pay attention to the flavors that it releases, how the
texture of the fruit changes as you continue to chew it, and the way it feels between your
teeth. Notice when the intention to swallow begins, and how that feels. Finally, as you begin
to swallow, pay attention of the movement of the fruit into the back of your mouth, and your
esophagus.

Repeat this practice as you take your next bites out of the fruit. You might even reflect, in
between bites, on how this fruit was grown and cared for, both by conditions of nature and by
the actions of human beings, until you were able to bring it home. This may help you to rec-
ognize how things around you are connected—even something as simple as a piece of fruit.

My observations during mindful eating:

Walk Mindfully

For this activity, choose a space, perhaps in your home, where you have some room to walk
around—such as a long hallway or a room with enough space to walk in a circle. It will be
elpful if you can have somebody read these instructions to you while you practice.

Begin by standing still, noticing the physical sensations on the bottom of your feet, where
they make contact with the floor, and noticing the weight of your body that is supported by
your legs and feet. When you are ready, slowly shift the weight of your body onto your right
‘oot, noticing the sensations that you experience in your right leg and foot as you relieve your
eft leg from your weight. Then, as you lift your left foot from the ground, guide your attention
to the sensations in your left foot and leg as they lift, and then as they descend downward and
orward, and the heel makes contact with the ground.

140


Step 5: Become Mindful

With your left foot firmly on the ground, gently guide your awareness to the sensations
you feel as you shift your body weight to the left side, noticing how the weight of your body
is received by your left leg and foot, and noticing the sensation of lightness on your right leg
and foot as they are relieved of the weight. Now, gently lift your right foot from the ground
and, as you move it forward, pay attention to the sensations in your right leg and foot as you
place your right heel to the floor, shifting your weight off of the left leg and foot and on to
the right side.

Notice the patterns of changing sensations in your two legs and feet as you make this
step. If your mind wanders away from this process of walking, simply notice it and gently bring
your attention back to the sensations in your legs and feet. Practice walking mindfully for a
few minutes.

My observations during mindful walking:

Breathing Mindfully

Since we are all breathing all of the time, mindful breathing can be a “go-to” skill that
you can use any time, in any situation, as a way of redirecting your attention to the
present moment. It can be very useful when you are first trying to learn mindfulness
skills, as you can use it like this: Any time you are having difficulty guiding your
attention to a particular sensation, you can always just spend a few moments focusing
on your breath, and then return to the specific activity that you were doing. In addic-
tion recovery, mindful breathing can be a very useful tool when you experience an
uncomfortable emotion or craving. Once you learn how to breathe mindfully, you'll
have a mindfulness technique you can use specifically for coping with cravings or
urges to drink or use. Let’s begin with a brief practice of breathing with awareness.

141


The Addiction Recovery Skills Workbook

Exercise 7.3: Breathing with Awareness

Like all of the other exercises you've completed so far, remember when you try this one that
it is not intended to change the way you breathe or to relax you (even though you might find
that one or both of these things occur). The purpose of the exercise is simply to become aware
of your breath and to observe it with openness and curiosity. You can begin by doing this
exercise for about five minutes, and as you practice it more often, you can increase the time
you spend on it to as long as thirty minutes, if it is comfortable to do so.

Begin by finding a comfortable place to sit. Bring your awareness to the way your body
feels in the chair, and to where it makes contact with the chair and the floor. Spend a few
moments exploring these sensations.

When you are ready, turn your attention to your breath. Notice how your breath enters
your body through your nose and moves through your body to your lungs. You may notice that
your abdomen rises and falls with each inhale and exhale. If it is helpful in connecting your
attention to the experience of breathing, you can try placing your hand on your abdomen.

Observe whatever you can about your breath, with openness and curiosity. Gently guide
your attention to the temperature of your breath, noticing if it becomes cooler or warmer as
you breathe in and as you breathe out. Notice the air entering your body with each inhale
and exiting your body with each exhale.

Whether your breathing is slow or fast, deep or shallow, just allow your body to breathe
how it breathes naturally, without judging it or trying to change it in any way. As thoughts
enter your mind, just notice them and allow them to be there, gently guiding your awareness
back to your breath. Practice breathing with awareness in this way for a few minutes.

Putting It All Together: Using Mindfulness
for Addiction Recovery

You might be wondering how mindful breathing, showering, and walking are going to
help you recover successfully from your addiction. They may seem unrelated, but
now that you have practiced a little bit of mindful awareness, you can apply what
you've learned to help you cope with urges and temptations to use alcohol or drugs,
without slipping into automatic pilot mode (which can lead you to unhealthy deci-
sions and behaviors, like relapsing). The practice of remaining connected with your

142


Step 5: Become Mindful

present experience can help you get through a craving without relapsing for the fol-
lowing reasons:

* One of the ways that you might naturally react to a craving is to try to avoid
the discomfort that it brings. Drinking or using is one way that you might
have avoided that discomfort in the past. If you can learn to accept, toler-
ate, and even curiously observe the sensations you experience during a
craving, you can break that cycle of drinking or using to avoid those
sensations.

* Your automatic reaction to a temptation (such as alcohol or drugs in your
immediate environment) or to a specific trigger (such as an unpleasant
emotion) is to drink or use. When you practice mindful awareness, rather
than reacting to the temptation, you can learn how to thoughtfully and
mindfully respond to it.

What's the difference between reacting and responding? you might be wondering. Reacting
is something that we do automatically, without thinking. When we feel that we are
standing too close to something hot, such as a fire, we react intuitively by moving
away from it. Our intuition says, That doesn’t feel good; it can hurt you. Get away from it.
When you are addicted to something, your intuition may not lead you to a healthy
decision that favors your recovery. Remember that intuition is not something that
involves weighing the consequences of your behavior. If you rely on your intuition,
you may react to temptations and difficult situations in ways that feel self-protective
(such as drinking or using to eliminate discomfort), but are not.

When you practice being connected with your experience of temptations and
uncomfortable sensations during a craving, you can begin to trace these experiences
back and understand how they have led you to automatic responses such as drinking
or using in the past. In the here and now, when you practice mindfulness during a
craving, you can connect with what is happening and observe it first, and then decide,
with awareness, how you would like to choose to respond to it. When you approach your
experience this way, rather than letting your addicted brain guide you to an auto-
matic, conditioned response to a craving or temptation (like drinking or using), you
can exercise more control over your behavior, weighing its consequences before you
act. In this next exercise, you will learn a mindfulness technique that you can use
when you experience a craving or temptation to drink or use.

Exercise 7.4: SOBER Breathing

Now that you have some experience with mindful breathing, this technique for connecting

with the present moment will probably be very easy for you to learn. It takes just a minute or
two to practice, making it an ideal go-to skill when you're in a tempting, stressful, or otherwise
upsetting situation. You can use the acronym SOBER to help you remember the steps (Bowen,
Chawla, and Marlatt 2010), summarized below:

1.

Stop: When you find yourself in a tempting situation, the first thing you need to do to
connect with the present moment is to stop and step out of automatic pilot mode. When
you stop, you interrupt that automatic sequence of behaviors that can follow a craving
or a strong emotion, and it’s that very sequence that you are working on changing when
you are in addiction recovery.

Observe: Once you've stopped and stepped out of automatic pilot, the next step is to
observe your experience. Observe what is happening, right in the moment. Ask yourself
what you are feeling right now. Using the example of a craving, observe where you feel it
in your body, any thoughts you have about drinking or using, and any emotions you might
be experiencing. Notice yourself allowing the presence of these uncomfortable aspects of
your experience—letting them be just as they are, rather than pushing them away.

Breathe: You've taken yourself out of automatic pilot and observed your present experi-
ence. The next step is to connect with your breath. Take a moment to do this, guiding your
attention to the movement of your breath.

Expand your awareness: Broadening your focus from the movement of your breath, you
can now expand your awareness to include your entire body as a whole, connecting with
all of the sensations you are experiencing in the present moment.

Respond mindfully: We've been talking about responding with mindful awareness, rather
than reacting in automatic pilot. This is the final step in the SOBER breathing exercise.
Now that you have connected with your experience and your breath, you can consider
the range of choices that you have in this situation. Recognize that you can accept the
discomfort that you're feeling. And while you are allowing it to be there, just as it is, you
can still respond by choosing, with mindful awareness, what action to take. You are in
a better place to consider the consequences of the different choices you can make, and
choose to respond to the discomfort you are experiencing in a way that is nurturing, self-
protective, and consistent with your recovery goals.

144


Step 5: Become Mindful

One way that you can begin to practice the SOBER breathing exercise is to imagine a
situation in which you would tempted to drink or use. As you picture yourself in this situa-
tion, practice the SOBER mindful awareness technique. First, stop. Next, observe what is
happening to you as you imagine yourself in this situation, focusing on any discomfort you
feel physically, emotionally, or in your thoughts. The goal is to acknowledge the discomfort
without judging yourself for it or trying to change it. Third, focus on your breath. Then expand
your awareness to include your whole body, noticing any sensations you might be experienc-
ing. And finally, imagining yourself in this risky situation, think about the choices that you can
make, as part of the process of responding mindfully. Ask yourself how you can best take care
of yourself and preserve your recovery in this situation.

Imagine yourself making the best choice you could in that situation, the response that
will keep you clean and sober. Maybe it’s leaving the situation, or calling a friend, or finding
a way to distract yourself. Whatever response you decide upon, guide your attention to the
way that you feel after making this choice, noticing the sensations you experience in your
body, how you are feeling emotionally, and any thoughts you might be having. Following this
exercise, jot down a few notes about anything you noticed as you used the SOBER breathing
technique, including any sensations, thoughts, emotions, or judgments you might have had
about your experience.

My observations during my SOBER breathing exercise:

To become comfortable enough with the SOBER breathing technique to use it any time
you need a “go-to” skill to cope with an unpleasant emotion or craving, try practicing using
it in a range of situations:

Start by practicing when you're feeling stressed. Write down some notes about your sensa-
tions, thoughts, and feelings, and any judgments, distractions, or other aspects of your experi-
ence. Was it helpful in this situation?

145


The Addiction Recovery Skills Workbook

My observations from using SOBER in a stressful situation:

Try the exercise when you experience an unpleasant emotion—such as sadness, anxiety,

anger, or any other emotion that you tend to react to in automatic pilot mode, without think-
ing about it.

My observations from using SOBER in response to an unpleasant emotion:

Try using SOBER breathing when you experience a temptation or craving to drink or use.

Acceptance

Throughout this chapter, whether you've realized it or not, you've been working on
acceptance. Each of the mindfulness meditation exercises you've done so far has
involved some instruction about letting whatever you experience be as it is, even if
it is unpleasant. That is the practice of acceptance. Why is this so important in
recovery, you might be wondering? It is important because acceptance is the oppo-
site of what your addicted brain tells you to do. Learning to practice acceptance can
help you conquer your addicted brain, and put your rational brain in charge.

You might recall learning, in chapter 1, about the addicted brain’s tendency to
get stuck in go mode. The go mode is the part of you that says, Get rid of that craving
before it feels any worse. Go. Have a drink, or You don’t have to feel sad. Go. Smoke some
weed. You'll feel so much better. Or if you tend to use when you feel good rather than
when you feel bad, your addicted brain might be saying, Why let this good feeling end?
Go. Use some cocaine. Until now, the voice of your addicted brain has led you to use
alcohol or drugs either to avoid unpleasant feelings or to prolong positive ones.

One of the biggest challenges this poses in recovery is that the more you follow
your tendency to try and avoid or get rid of the unpleasant feelings and sensations
that cravings bring about, the more intense they tend to get. The same goes for
other uncomfortable emotions, such as sadness, grief, anxiety, or anger. When you
try to run away from these feelings, they usually come back stronger. A key aspect
of practicing mindfulness is learning to accept that discomfort is there, while rec-
ognizing at the same time that your actions don’t have to be dictated by your
natural desire to get rid of it. Here are a few things you can tell yourself to practice
acceptance:

* It’s okay for me to see things just as they are right now, as opposed to the way I think
they should be.

* Just because I accept the way that I am feeling right now, it doesn’t mean that I am
satisfied with the way things are, or that I have to give up on trying to make things
better.

* Once I see things for what they are, then I can find the energy to heal and to change
what is here.

Hillary’s Story

Hillary, a thirty-four-year old woman in recovery from alcohol and cocaine
addiction, lost her mom six months ago. Before that time, she had been sober for
nearly three months, and she helped her mother through a very difficult battle with
cancer before she died. After losing her mom, Hillary relapsed and started drinking
and using cocaine again. She felt like she just couldn't tolerate the sadness and the
emptiness, and drinking and using was the only way that she could escape it.

About two weeks ago, Hillary realized that the alcohol and cocaine she was
using were making her feel more and more depressed, so she decided to try getting
sober again. In the first few weeks of her recovery, a lot of sad thoughts and feelings
come rushing in about her mom, and at those moments, Hillary feels strong urges
to drink and use. When she begins practicing mindfulness, Hillary becomes more
comfortable with the idea of acceptance.

She starts to use the SOBER exercise during moments of sadness and grief about
her mom. When she observes those feelings in her mind and body, she brings her
attention to her breath. Using her breath to connect her attention to her mind and
body in the present moment, she is able to feel a little bit stronger and more able to
allow herself to feel the different emotions about her loss, and to say to herself, It’s
okay for me to feel what I’m feeling right now. It may not be what I want to feel, but I can
tolerate and accept it for what it is. I seem to be coping with it better than I thought I could.

I will just keep on trying to be present with it, since trying to escape it doesn’t really help.

With these thoughts in mind, she continues to practice breathing into the
experience and staying present with it, without turning to alcohol or cocaine to try
to numb it. Her sadness gradually becomes something that she can tolerate and
accept.

Compassion and Kindness

Kindness and compassion are both characteristics that can enable you to practice
mindfulness. For those of us who have the tendency to be self-critical, even though it

148


Step 5: Become Mindful

may come naturally to take a kind and compassionate approach to understanding
and communicating with others, we don’t necessarily use that same approach toward
ourselves. Being mindful is about being present in a nonjudgmental way; whatever
arises when practicing mindfulness, if you can have a kind and friendly spirit toward
it, you will be less likely to judge or criticize yourself for it. If you're distracted or
bothered by an urge or craving to drink or use when you are practicing mindfulness
meditation, and are able to connect with the experience with a kind and welcoming
spirit, this will have the effect of making you more open to your experience, and more
able to be present with it. Judgment, and the desire to escape or avoid things that are
unpleasant or unfamiliar, will be less likely to interfere with your mindfulness
practice.

Compassion is a close relative of kindness, but it is not exactly the same thing.
Compassion is a tender and sympathetic emotional reaction to the presence of pain
or sorrow. When you practice mindfulness, having compassion for yourself will help to
relieve you of negative and critical inner dialogues. These dialogues not only interfere
with your ability to remain present, but they can easily drive you to use alcohol or
drugs. When you approach your own pain and sorrow with compassion, you can
make choices about how to respond mindfully to those experiences in a way that is
nurturing and self-protective, preserving your recovery.

Wrap-up

In this chapter you had the opportunity to learn about what mindfulness is, and how
developing a practice of mindfulness can be helpful to you in your recovery. By acquir-
ing the skills that enable you to approach daily life mindfully, you are making great
strides in accepting the discomfort that you naturally face during recovery and taking
a more open, accepting approach to dealing with it. This is not an easy thing to do,
but with practice, you can use this approach to stay in control of your responses to
cravings and other difficult experiences, rather than reacting to these experiences
impulsively, with your addicted brain in the driver's seat.

In the next chapter, you’re going to find ways to increase joy, pleasure, and fulfill-
ment in your life. With mindfulness skills in your back pocket, you will be able to
experience these positive emotions at a deeper level.

149




CHAPTER 8

Step 6: Rediscover
Rewards

y now, you have learned a lot about how to cope with triggers and cravings.

You know all about the kinds of situations, places, people, and things that

make you vulnerable to relapsing, and you can plan ahead for how you are
going to deal with them. But there is a big gap that still needs to be addressed to make
your recovery plan complete. Now that you are not going to be drinking or using,
what will you do to fill the void that the absence of alcohol and drugs will leave in
your life?

Let’s face it: you are working your way through this book because you know that
drinking or using has become destructive in your life. But knowing that doesn’t mean
that giving it up is easy. It doesn’t mean that you don’t miss the escape or the positive
feelings that you used to get from alcohol or drugs. And you might find that, when
you are early in the process of recovery, your mood is up and down, and you don’t
enjoy many things that you used to. Not everybody feels that way, but a large major-
ity of people who are in recovery feel that way at first. So, if you’re wondering what
you're going to get those pleasurable feelings from, if not from drinking or using, you
are not alone. In this chapter, you will discover and rediscover rewarding activities for
your recovering brain and body, and learn how to overcome some of the barriers that
stand in the way of experiencing joy.


The Addiction Recovery Skills Workbook

The Role of Rewards in Addiction
and Recovery

Rewards are a central part of all of our lives; they are the reason we are motivated to
get up in the morning, take care of our responsibilities (whether those involve work,
household, or other duties), and maintain a social life, family relationships, and
hobbies. All of these things that we spend our time doing, we do because we antici-
pate that they will bring us rewards: emotional, financial, physical, and other types
of rewards that provide joy and pleasure in life.

Working, for example, can bring about all kinds of rewards: There is, of course,
the financial reward when you get paid for the work that you do. If colleagues or
bosses at work tell you that you are doing a good job, then that brings emotional
rewards, such as feelings of confidence and pride in your work, and a sense that you
are liked and appreciated by others. All of those experiences will, of course, enhance
your self-esteem and feelings of self-worth, which are even greater psychological
rewards. Whether you have a job in an office, go to school, or carry out your primary
responsibilities at home, the rewards you get from those responsibilities are at the
core of your motivation to keep on fulfilling them.

What does this have to do with addiction recovery? you might ask. Think back to before
you started drinking or using. What were the rewarding things in your life? Did they
have to do with the pleasure you experienced from your important relationships with
family, children, a partner, or friends? Were they connected to your hobbies? Your
work? Now think about how your involvement in those rewarding activities changed
as you started to drink or use more and more. When people become addicted to
drugs or alcohol, pursuing the “natural” sources of rewards in life becomes less and
less a part of the way that they spend their time. This is because of the increasing
amount of time that becomes devoted to seeking drugs or alcohol, using them, and
recovering from their effects (as in hangovers, crashing, depression, and the other
uncomfortable withdrawal effects that come after the use).

Does this sound familiar? To relate this to your personal experience with addic-
tion, think about the things you started to do less of as your use of alcohol or drugs
increased, and write them down in the space provided.

152


Step 6: Rediscover Rewards

Things | used to enjoy that | did less of as my drinking or drug use got out of control,
for example: spending time with friends or family, exercising, or pursuing hobbies:

In recovery, it is not uncommon to feel like your sources of pleasure are limited
without alcohol or drugs among your options. How will you spend your free time
now? What can replace the role that drinking or using had in your life, and will it feel
anywhere near as good? These are very normal and important questions that you
might be wondering about, and it may take you some time and trial-and-error to
figure out the answers. So be patient with yourself. The exercises you complete in this
chapter will help you to find new ways to experience joy and pleasure in recovery.

Studies show not only that rewards relate to the development of addiction, but also
that they’re very important in determining how successful people are at making changes
to their alcohol or drug use once they enter recovery. According to what is known as
behavioral economics theory, when people in addiction recovery have access to a range of
sources of pleasure, joy, and satisfaction, they are more likely to quit drinking or using
drugs successfully (Green and Kagel 1996; Higgins, Alessi, and Dantona 2002). This
theory has a lot of scientific evidence behind it. For example, in one study that com-
pared two different types of behavioral treatments for addiction, the people with the
most success in staying sober were those who got involved in a range of pleasurable
activities and did them frequently. It didn’t matter what type of treatment they
received—the single most important thing that determined whether people were able
to stay sober was their consistent involvement in a wide range of enjoyable activities.
These activities replaced the time and energy they had been spending on addictive

153


The Addiction Recovery Skills Workbook

behaviors, enabling them to experience pleasure without having to face the devastating
consequences of alcohol or drug use (Farabee, Rawson, and McCann 2002).

Behavioral Activation in Addiction Recovery

As studies have continued to prove how important it is for addicts in recovery to find
healthy ways of experiencing joy and fulfillment, a treatment approach that has been
used to help people with depression to do this very thing has recently been applied to
the treatment of addiction as well. This approach, called behavioral activation therapy,
is focused on motivating people to get involved in pleasant activities on a regular
basis (Daughters et al. 2008; Magidson et al. 2011).

Behavioral activation therapy has been found to be very helpful to people who
struggle with depression, because depression can cause a loss of motivation to do
enjoyable things (Cuijpers, Smit, and van Straten 2007; Mazzucchelli, Kane, and
Rees 2009; Sturmey 2009). This becomes part of a vicious cycle: when people stop
doing pleasurable things, their mood tends to get worse, which makes them more
vulnerable to addictive behaviors; and as addictive behaviors take over, less and less
time is devoted to doing enjoyable activities. Recent studies have shown that, when
used to help people who struggle with both addiction and depression, Behavioral
activation therapy helps them successfully quit their use of drugs and alcohol and
improves symptoms of depression at the same time (Daughters et al. 2008; Magidson
et al. 2011).

Bringing Pleasure into Recovery

As you begin to think about how you'd like to incorporate pleasant activities into
your life, keep the following suggestions in mind. You'll get to explore these sugges-
tions in more depth when you complete the exercises in this chapter:

¢ Be sure that you select activities carefully, so as not to choose something
that may trigger a craving or a temptation.

¢ An important goal is to create a balance between things that you enjoy
doing and things that you do to fulfill responsibilities. There is an impor-
tant difference between the two.

154


Step 6: Rediscover Rewards

¢ To increase your chances of actually getting around to doing pleasant activ-
ities, try scheduling them.

¢ When you schedule pleasant activities, consider what your most risky times
of day are (in other words, when you are the most vulnerable to relapsing),
and try to plan them during those times.

¢ Keep in mind that your assumptions about whether you'll enjoy a particu-
lar activity may be wrong. In exercise 8.5 (Pleasure Predicting), you can
explore this idea further and see how it applies to you.

Pleasant Activities vs. Risky Situations

Now that you are getting used to living a lifestyle that supports your recovery, you
are going to learn to be thoughtful in new and different ways about the activities you
choose to do. As you start to plan how you will spend your time, you might try asking
yourself, before you decide to do something (such as going to a movie or a concert, or
hanging out with certain friends): Is this something that might trigger me to want to drink
or use? Sometimes, without realizing it, we can be drawn to certain activities that
used to be associated with drinking or using. Let’s consider an example:

Daniel Gets Triggered

Daniel has been abstinent from using marijuana for five weeks now. His friend
Holden calls him up and invites him to go to a concert featuring an artist Daniel
has seen several times before and would love to see again. This is great, Daniel
thinks to himself. I didn’t know what I was going to do tonight, and now I have something
to occupy my time. What Daniel doesn’t realize is that both Holden and this concert
are risky for his recovery. He used to smoke pot with Holden all the time, and he
has never been to see this particular artist in concert when he wasn’t high. When
he gets to the concert, he finds himself with a craving he rates as an 8 in intensity
ona scale from 1 to 10. Holden has some weed, so Daniel ends up smoking with
him that night.

155


The Addiction Recovery Skills Workbook

In this situation, Daniel was trying to find something pleasurable to do, but he
didn’t make the link between the music he was going to listen to at the concert and
his prior marijuana use. He also didn’t recognize how the cards were stacked against
him with his friend Holden coming with him. While Daniel had quit five weeks ago
and no longer had his own supply, Holden made it easy for him to access the
marijuana.

Now, with the knowledge that he chose a risky situation when he intended to plan
a pleasant activity, Daniel can think through how he might have planned to do things
differently if he had asked himself the question, Could this concert trigger me to want to
use? beforehand. If he had realized that Holden and the music itself could be triggers,
there are a few ways he could have handled the situation differently:

* He could have avoided the concert completely. This would be the safest
choice, especially in early recovery. At this stage, Daniel’s ability to resist
temptations is likely at its weakest, and he hasn't yet learned all of the
coping strategies that he needs to have in place to take on something so
risky.

* He could have gone to the concert, but not with Holden. One way of pro-
tecting himself from a potential relapse would be to find a supportive sober
friend to go with him, and discuss a plan with that friend for how he would
handle himself if he were to have a craving (for example, leave early, or tell
the friend about it and talk it through).

Daniel’s example is included to give you a good sense of how to ask yourself the
right questions about a planned activity so that you can learn to tell the difference
between a healthy, pleasant activity and a risky situation. If you schedule your time
in advance, and give thoughtful consideration to what you are planning, you can
avoid placing yourself in a triggering situation.

156


Step 6: Rediscover Rewards

Exercise 8.1: Activity Tracking

The first step in developing a healthy, rewarding life is to get an accurate sense of how you are
spending your time, and how your current activities relate to your mood and use of alcoho
or drugs. To do this, using the form below, you are going to record all of your daily activities,
including the ones that may seem unimportant (like watching TV). You don’t need to change
the way you are doing anything just yet; you will brainstorm about how to make positive
changes a little bit later in this chapter. For now, the tracking will help you to get a sense o'
your current patterns of activities, moods, and behaviors.

Using the activity tracking form works best when you fill out the form twice per day—
once in the afternoon, and once in the evening. When you use this form, you will rate how
much you enjoyed each activity, from 0 to 10, with 0 meaning it was not at all enjoyable and
10 meaning it was extremely enjoyable. There is no “correct” rating for any activity; you are
simply doing this to notice patterns. So, for example, if you spent the hour from 6:00 to 7:00
cooking dinner, and you really did not enjoy it, you would rate it a 0 or a 1.

A “pleasant” or “enjoyable” activity is anything that you rate a 6 or higher. At the end o
the day, you will add up how many pleasant activities (rated 6 or higher) you did, and you wil
rate your overall mood on that day on a scale from 0 to 10, with O meaning your mood was
as low as it can get, and 10 meaning that your mood couldn't have been better. You'll also
rate your most intense craving of the day from 1 to 10, with 1 meaning it was very mild and
10 meaning that it was extremely strong. Finally, you'll indicate whether or not you drank or

used on that day. Complete this form on a daily basis for at least one week. You can down-
load fresh copies of it at http://www.newharbinger.com/32783.

The Addiction Recovery Skills Workbook

The more frequently you track your activities, the better able you will be to rec-
ognize patterns that you might want to change. Using the previous form, you will
start to see the connections between your moods and your activity level, both of
which are related to your use of alcohol and drugs. People who do more pleasurable
things tend to be happier, and the happiness makes them want to do more enjoyable
things.

If you have a therapist or counselor, review your activity tracking form with him
or her, and try to set some goals around the changes you'd like to make to it. If you
don’t have a therapist or counselor, try to look for patterns: When you do more pleas-
ant activities, are your mood ratings any different? What about your cravings? Maybe
the activities help both, or maybe only one. Either way, understanding how your
activities relate to your mood and cravings is part of strengthening your skill set as a
self expert. You can then make adjustments to your activities according to what your
needs are on any given day.

Balancing “Should Dos” with “Want Tos”

As you are reading this chapter, you might find yourself thinking, I’m a pretty
active person. I do a lot of stuff: Do I really need to do more? The answer to that depends.
Are the things you are spending your time doing things that you are obligated to do,
or are they things that you find enjoyable? The key is to have a balance between the
two. Often the scale is tipped in the direction of lots of “should dos,” or activities that
are part of your responsibilities. This can feel very unfulfilling, and can lead to guilt,
confusion, or dissatisfaction with life. On the other hand, when people are doing a lot
of pleasurable activities and not working on any long-term goals, this can create a
void, or a feeling of underachieving or not accomplishing enough. Let’s take a look at
your personal balance of responsibility and fun, so that you can decide where you
need to focus your efforts.

Step 6: Rediscover Rewards

Exercise 8.2: “Should Dos” and “Want Tos”

For this exercise, you are simply going to make a list of the things that you do to fulfill respon-
sibilities (your “should dos”) and the things that you do for fun (“want tos”), so that you can
get a sense of how balanced they are.

What did you notice during this exercise? Was it hard for you to come up with
things that you do for pleasure, or was it the other way around? Pay attention to
where you see a gap in your activity balance, so that you can begin to brainstorm
about ways to have satisfying numbers and types of activities in both categories.

Exercise 8.3: Pleasant Activities

Ideally, you should have one pleasant activity worked into each day. It doesn’t have to take
up a lot of time; it just needs to be something you do with the intention of enjoying yourself. In

When Things Get in the Way

Sometimes, things just get in the way of our doing things for fun. It could be a
practical problem, like figuring out who will watch the kids or walk the dog, or how
to free up your busy schedule. For this reason, scheduling activities in advance can
be helpful, because it will lead you to plan for these kinds of obstacles. Looking at the
list of pleasant activities that you planned in the previous exercise, take a few moments
to think about potential barriers, or things that might prevent you from doing one or
more of them despite your best intentions. Make a list of these obstacles below.

OBSTACLES TO PLEASANT ACTIVITIES:

164


Step 6: Rediscover Rewards

Now, for each of the obstacles that you listed, there is a three-step process you can
follow to find a realistic solution:

¢ First: brainstorm a list of all of the possible solutions that you can think of.

¢ Second: think about the pros and cons of each of the solutions, and narrow
it down to the best one or two approaches.

¢ Third: try one of the best approaches, and see how well it works to free you
up or otherwise enable you to do the pleasant activity.

Let’s practice this now, with the first barrier that you identified.

Barrier #1:

Step 1: Here are all of the possible solutions | can think of for this problem:

165

166


Step 6: Rediscover Rewards

Once you've tried one or both of these, evaluate how well they worked, so that you
can decide which solution you'd like to use again in the future.

In addition to practical obstacles, our thoughts can sometimes run interference
with doing pleasant activities. Often we think that we won't enjoy something because
we are too tired, or we're not in a good mood, or we just don’t feel like doing any-
thing. But sometimes we are wrong. Remember how we worked on recognizing cogni-
tive distortions in chapter 5? We are going to revisit cognitive distortions, specifically
as they relate to pleasant activities, here.

Negative moods can affect our expectations about how much we can enjoy things.
That is, if your mood isn’t great, you probably don’t expect that going out for dinner
or being with other people is going to be enjoyable, simply because you don’t feel like
it. But the reality can be quite different from what you expected, because the activity
itself can change your mood. Below are a few examples of thoughts that can get in the
way of getting out and doing something fun:

* I don't feel like it.

¢ It won't be any fun.

¢ I'm just going to want to leave and go home.

* It will be a waste of time.

¢ I'm going to ruin everyone else’s fun with my bad mood.

Do any of these thoughts sound familiar? If not, then perhaps negative thoughts
are not such a big barrier for you personally. If they are familiar, you should know
that these are very common ways of thinking, and there is a way that you can change
these thoughts, just as you've learned to change some of your irrational ways of
thinking about drinking or using. Below you will be introduced to a technique that
will help you learn how to challenge your thoughts about pleasant activities.

167


The Addiction Recovery Skills Workbook

Exercise 8.5: Pleasure Predicting

As you are learning, our thoughts and feelings about activities can be very misleading at

times. The idea behind pleasure predicting is that we can act like scientists, examining our
negative thoughts and expectations about activities and gathering evidence to see whether
or not they turn out to be accurate. According to this approach, just because you don’t feel

like doing something doesn’t mean that it isn’t worth doing. You can choose to do something
and then decide whether it was enjoyable, based on your observations about your thoughts
and your mood during and after the activity. Here’s how to do it:

168

First, when you're planning to do an activity, before you do it, write down how much
you expect to enjoy it, using a percentage from 0 to 100, with O meaning that you
don’t expect to enjoy it all, 50 percent meaning that you think you will enjoy it mod-
erately, and 100 percent meaning that you expect that you will enjoy it to the fullest
extent possible. Pay attention to any other thoughts you are having about the activity
and write them down.

Then, do the activity, even if you rated it a 0. Without this step, you can’t do pleasure
predicting!
During the activity, pay attention to any thoughts you are having about it and jot them

down.

After you finish the activity, rate how much you actually enjoyed it, from 0 to 100
percent.

Compare the enjoyment ratings from before and after you did the activity. These plea-
sure ratings might be different, or they might not be; either way, it’s okay. The idea is
to be an objective observer of your experience and begin to identify patterns.

The Addiction Recovery Skills Workbook

What did you notice about your ratings before and after the activities? In some
cases, you might find that while you approach certain activities with a sense of dread,
or with low expectations about how much fun you will have, you get more enjoyment
out of them than you expect. These are, of course, the types of activities that you'll
want to repeat, and you can remind yourself of how your predictions might have been
more about your mood than about the activity itself. In other situations, you might
find that the activity was just as you expected it to be.

Remember that in recovery, you are going to be redefining the way that you spend
your time, and an important part of this will involve figuring out what kinds of
things you can enjoy without feeling triggered to drink or use. The things you enjoy
that are not risky for you now may not be the same things that were pleasurable and
safe for you when you were actively drinking or using. If you look at pleasure predict-
ing as a process of discovery, you can find ways to experience joy and fun in recovery,
which will help you stay healthy and sober.

Exercise 8.7: Reward Yourself for Scheduling and
Following Through

Now that you have some experience with pleasure predicting, you might have some activi-
ties in mind that you'd like to repeat, because you found that you enjoyed them. Scheduling
activities helps to make it more likely that you'll follow through, because you've already com-
mitted to it and worked your way through any barriers in terms of scheduling. To take it a
step further, after you do an activity that you planned and committed to, you should reward
yourself for following through, just as you did in chapter 4 when you worked on incorporating
physical exercise into your routine. In this exercise, you will schedule your next few activities
for the coming week, and plan how you will reward yourself afterward.

Wrap-up

In this chapter you learned about how you can reintroduce pleasurable activities into
your life in a way that is compatible with your recovery. Finding balance between
work and fun is a lifelong practice. Things aren’t always in perfect balance; there will
be times when you find yourself doing more work and fulfilling responsibilities, with

less time for fun, and other times when you have a little more free time on your
hands. With continued awareness of your goal to keep things in balance as much as
possible, you will get better and better at it, and this will serve your recovery well.
The more joy and pleasure you come to derive from relationships, hobbies, and other
activities, the less you will miss the presence of alcohol or drugs in your life.

CHAPTER 9

Step 7: Conquer
Challenging Emotions

need skills on board for dealing with some of the other unpleasant feelings
that are common in recovery, such as anxiety, sadness, and anger. Most of
the CBT, mindfulness, and motivational techniques you've already learned can actu-
ally help you with these types of emotions. To mobilize these “go-to” skills in a dif-
ferent way, we will review how you can use them when negative feelings come up.
You will face your share of ups and downs in this new phase of your life. Getting
equipped to anticipate and cope with them without relapsing will be the focus of this
chapter.

N ow that you have some helpful strategies for coping with cravings, you will

Managing Your Mood

More often than not, addictions go hand in hand with other psychological problems.
Studies show that as many as two-thirds of people with addictions have mental health
issues, the most common of which are anxiety and mood disorders, such as depres-
sion (Glasner-Edwards et al. 2009). This is not surprising, right? It makes sense that
alcohol or other substances could become a sort of “refuge” for dealing with unpleas-
ant emotions or symptoms.

By now, if you are someone who used to self-medicate your depression or anxiety
by drinking or using, you've probably learned that in the long run, alcohol and drugs
are not the most effective antidepressants. In fact, they make depression and anxiety


The Addiction Recovery Skills Workbook

worse over time. But at the time when you started using them that way, they proba-
bly made pretty good Band-Aids. To avoid falling back into the trap of drinking or
using as a Band-Aid for negative emotions, you can use the following techniques,
which you've already practiced for coping with cravings: (1) monitoring and challeng-
ing negative thoughts that lead to triggering emotions, (2) revisiting your motivation
to remain abstinent, (3) engaging in pleasant activities and other behavioral coping
strategies, and (4) using mindfulness-based coping skills. We will briefly review how
to apply each of these approaches to coping with negative moods below.

Know Your Negative Emotional Triggers

Back in chapter 5, you completed an exercise on identifying your internal triggers.
Those emotional triggers may have included depression, anxiety, anger, jealousy, irri-
tability, boredom, rejection, frustration, guilt or shame, or feeling overwhelmed. Turn
back to that exercise (5.1) and review your internal emotional triggers. If you can be
one step ahead of these triggers—meaning that you are able to recognize when the
emotions are coming on, before they're full-blown and driving you into relapse
mode—then you can stay ahead in your recovery, preventing a relapse before the trig-
gering events can lead you there.

Mood Monitoring

We all feel down sometimes. In early recovery in particular, it is very common to
feel sad or depressed on and off for a period of time. This can often be explained by
the withdrawal syndrome—in other words, the effects of alcohol or drugs leaving
your body. After a month or longer of abstinence from drug or alcohol use, these
symptoms may resolve themselves. In some people, however, those depressed feelings
persist for longer, and may require additional treatment using medications or therapy.

If you find that you have lingering depression symptoms, it is important to get
them evaluated and properly treated, as they can lower your chances of success in
addiction recovery if they are not managed (Glasner-Edwards et al. 2009). A list of
common symptoms of depression follows; if a few of these persist for longer than a
month after you've gotten sober, you should consult a professional for evaluation and
possible treatment recommendations.

Cognitive Distortions That Lead to Depression
and Anxiety

In chapter 6, you took an in-depth look at cognitive distortions that lead to red
flag thoughts. As it turns out, these same categories of distortions can lead you to
think in ways that fuel sadness and anxiety. Below, you'll find examples of anxious
and depressing thoughts in each of the categories of irrational thoughts that you
learned about in chapter 6.

¢ Black-or-white thinking: When you think of things this way, you see
things as all good or all bad. For example: My date canceled for Saturday night.
I'm always going to be alone.

175


The Addiction Recovery Skills Workbook

Discounting the positive: When you ignore or devalue the positive aspects
of a situation, you end up paying attention only to the potential negatives.
For example: My friend probably only complimented my outfit because she feels
sorry for me. I know I look awful.

Jumping to conclusions: Just as it sounds, this distortion happens when
you make assumptions about a person or situation without any evidence to
support them. One type of distorted thought in this category is fortune
telling, or making assumptions about what will happen in the future. For
example: I’m not going to get that job. It won't work out for me, just like everything
else I try.

Taking your feelings too seriously: This mistake in thinking happens
when you take a feeling you're having in the moment and assume that it is
a true reflection of your reality. For example: I don’t feel like I can enjoy any-
thing. I'm just going to live my life in misery.

Self-blame: This cognitive distortion occurs when you assume an excessive
amount of blame for your problems. For example: I created my own problems
by making so many bad decisions about drinking and using. My depression is my own

fault.

Labeling: When you use a negative label to describe yourself, it fuels nega-
tive moods. For example: Only losers like me need treatment for an addiction. I
was too weak to keep it under control.

Although there are other types of cognitive distortions, these examples should
give you a sense of the types of thoughts linked with depression and anxiety that fit
into the various categories of mistakes in thinking. In this next exercise, you are
going to begin tracking your own emotionally triggering thoughts, and monitoring
how they relate to your cravings for alcohol or drugs.

Exercise 9.1: Mood and Craving Log

To begin to understand what types of thoughts may trigger you to feel sad or depressed,

complete the following log, including the specific thoughts, along with a depression rating

176


Step 7: Conquer Challenging Emotions

rom 1 to 10—with 1 meaning very slightly depressed, and 10 being the most depressed.

alcohol or drugs on that same day.

The Addiction Recovery Skills Workbook

Now that you've had some experience with rating your moods and cravings, can
you see a connection between them? Do you tend to have stronger cravings on days
when you have more frequent depressing thoughts? Or is it when you have a higher
depression rating (when the thoughts affect your mood more negatively)? Are there
themes or situations that are coming up repeatedly that trigger depressing thoughts?
Just take notice of these patterns as a way of deepening your self-understanding.
Continue to complete these ratings for at least a few weeks using this form, which is
available at http://www.newharbinger.com/32783. Knowing what makes you depressed
and how this relates to urges to drink or use will help you to anticipate urges on a
down day and put some of your new coping skills to use to get you through it without
relapsing.

Anxiety Monitoring

As you are learning more about the mood symptoms that may make you vulner-
able to relapse, it might help you to know that mood and anxiety symptoms often go
hand in hand. That is, most people who suffer from depression also experience some
level of anxiety. There are different types of anxiety disorders; the most common
types that overlap with addiction are reviewed briefly below:

¢ Generalized anxiety disorder: People with this problem are chronic wor-
riers. If you have generalized anxiety disorder, you worry about a lot of
things, down to everyday decisions, and you have a hard time turning the
worry off. Along with your worried thoughts, you experience anxiety symp-
toms such as fatigue, tension, irritability, or nausea. Other symptoms may
also be present.

¢ Social anxiety disorder: If you have social anxiety, it means that you get
very nervous when you are going to be around other people (whether social-
izing, meeting new people, or speaking in front of others at work or in
another setting). This form of anxiety often stems from feeling self-
conscious about how others will view or judge you. Your self-consciousness
is so anxiety provoking that it leads to very uncomfortable symptoms, like
shortness of breath, sweating, heart palpitations, nausea, dizziness, or other
symptoms.

178


Step 7: Conquer Challenging Emotions

¢ Panic attacks or panic disorder: Panic attacks involve a sudden rush of
intense fear that occurs completely out of the blue, along with anxiety
symptoms including shortness of breath; sweating; feeling faint; heart
racing; nausea; or fear of losing control, going crazy, or dying. When you
have repeated panic attacks and begin to fear them, you can develop panic
disorder.

¢ Post-traumatic stress disorder: This anxiety disorder can develop in
someone who has been exposed to a traumatic event. This event could
involve witnessing or experiencing a life-threatening situation or a natural
disaster, and in that situation feeling very helpless or horrified. In some
people, these experiences lead to anxiety symptoms that may include
feeling numb, having nightmares or flashbacks, feeling depressed or hope-
less about the future, having trouble connecting emotionally with others,
or avoiding things that remind them of the traumatic event.

If you think that you may suffer from any of these problems, it is advisable for you
to get evaluated by a mental health professional to confirm a diagnosis and consider
some treatment recommendations. You may find, though, that you have some symp-
toms of worry, anxiety, or panic even if it is not a diagnosable disorder. These symp-
toms could worsen temporarily in early recovery, as alcohol or drugs leave your body
and you begin to experience some of the emotions that you might have been sup-
pressing while you were drinking or using. With the log below, you can start record-
ing your anxious thoughts, just as you did for your depression, to get a sense of how
frequently they are happening, what situations they are linked to, and how they
might relate to your cravings or urges to use.

Exercise 9.2: Anxiety and Craving Log

To begin to understand what types of thoughts may trigger you to feel anxious, complete
the following log, including thoughts that make you feel anxious or nervous, along with an
anxiety rating from 1 to 10, with 1 meaning very slightly anxious, and 10 being the most
anxious you've felt. Also complete a craving rating from 0 to 10, representing your overall
level of cravings for alcohol or drugs on that same day.

Step 7: Conquer Challenging Emotions

Just as you did with your log of depressing thoughts, take a look at your responses
here and look for patterns. How do your anxious thoughts relate to your cravings for
alcohol or drugs? Do you notice any themes or situations that are common to many
of your anxious thoughts? Use this exercise to continue to build your self expertise.
Do you need to read up more on anxiety and how to manage it? Or are depressing
thoughts more of an issue for you? Understanding the emotions that you experience
that make you the most vulnerable will empower you in your healing process. If you
are currently in counseling or therapy, you can review these exercises with your coun-
selor or therapist.

Challenging Negative Thoughts

Earlier in this workbook, you learned to challenge red flag thoughts using the
three T’s: (1) identifying the triggering situation, (2) describing the thought, and (3)
placing the thought on trial. You can use the same strategy to challenge negative,
depressing, or anxious thinking—what we'll call dysfunctional thoughts. Let’s con-
sider Alicia’s example:

Alicia’s Negative Thinking

Alicia has been sober from alcohol for nearly a month. She is invited to a work
party at a restaurant with a bar, where she knows that many of her colleagues will
be drinking and dancing. Alicia decides to invite Vince, a new love interest of hers
who is also sober. She and Vince have been out for coffee together a few times, on
his invitation, but this is the first time Alicia has asked him out. He enthusiastically
accepts her invitation, but then, on the day before the party, he tells her that he got
called in to work on a project and he won't be able to make it. He apologizes and
asks her if she’d like to go out for dinner another night, after his project is
completed. Alicia feels very hurt and rejected. She thinks, I was probably completely
wrong about him. I have nothing going for me. I’m sure Vince only said yes in the first place
because he feels sorry for me. I’m always going to be alone.

181


The Addiction Recovery Skills Workbook

In the past, Alicia would have wound up going to the party and drinking as a
result of these types of depressive and anxious thoughts, but this time she tries
thought challenging, using the three T’s:

Triggering situation: feeling rejected when Vince cancelled plans to go to the

party with her

Dysfunctional thoughts: J have nothing going for me, I'm sure Vince only said yes in
the first place because he feels sorry for me. I'm always going to be alone.

Thoughts on trial: Alicia examines the evidence that Vince didn’t really want to go

with her to the party:

Questions to Ask to
Examine the Evidence

The Facts

What evidence is there that
Vince only said _yes because
he felt sorry for me?

None, really. He said yes pretty enthusiastically.

Is there any evidence that
Vince actually likes me and
wanted to go with me?

Yes. First of all, we've been out before, and Vince was the
one who initiated those coffee dates every time we've been
out so far. Second, when he canceled, he actually followed
up immediately with an alternative plan, to go out to
dinner with me.

Is it true that I have
nothing going for me?

Well, I'd like to have more going for me, but right now
there are a few very good things I have going: I’m sober,
I have a job, and I’m very connected with my family.

Is there evidence that I’m
always going to be alone?

I am fortune telling. I don’t really know if I am going to be
alone or not. I have had several relationships, and even
though they haven't worked out, I haven't been alone for
most of my life. Also, whether or not I am in a romantic
relationship, I am not truly alone. I do have family and
friends, although I really would like to have a romantic
partner in my future.

182



Step 7: Conquer Challenging Emotions

Now that Alicia has considered her thoughts using the three T’s, she can see that
she made a few mistakes in thinking: she was discounting the positive when she told
herself that Vince was just feeling sorry for her; she was using black-or-white thinking
when she told herself that she had nothing going for herself, and she was jumping to
conclusions when she thought that she would always be alone. In the right hand column,
titled “The Facts,” Alicia successfully challenged and replaced her negative thoughts
with more rational thinking.

In this next exercise, you can practice challenging some of your own depressed or
anxious thoughts using the three T’s.

Exercise 9.3: Challenging Your Negative Thoughts

In this exercise, you are going to think about two recent situations in which you felt depressed
or anxious, and describe them. For each situation, you will write down the negative thought
that went through your mind, along with the emotion that you felt. After you identify the
thought error you made, you will practice the three T’s of thought challenging. You can refer
back to Exercise 6.1 to refresh your memory about how you did this when you were working
on your red flag thoughts.

Managing Anger

Do you ever find yourself losing your cool when you're angry? Most of us do, at
one time or another. If this is a frequent experience for you, and if anger is one of
your relapse triggers, then having some healthy coping tools and outlets for it is going
to come in really handy for you as you work toward your recovery.

One of the most important things to keep in mind is that there are many disad-
vantages to losing your temper, aside from how it feels and the potential for relapse
that it brings. When you raise your voice or otherwise act out aggressively in anger:

¢ You appear out of control.

* People don’t respect or take seriously what you are saying.
* You don’t get your needs met.

* You lose self-respect.

The first step to getting a handle on your anger is to understand how it feels, so
that you can anticipate when it’s coming on. Take a moment and think about how

185


The Addiction Recovery Skills Workbook

you experience anger. Where do you feel it in your body? What kinds of thoughts go
through your head when you are feeling angry? Jot down some notes about it below.

When | am angry:

These are the physical sensations | experience:

These are some of the thoughts that frequently go through my mind:

These are some of the ways that | express it when | can’t control it:

186


Step 7: Conquer Challenging Emotions

The next step to learning how to effectively manage anger is to figure out what
triggers it. In the exercise that follows, you are going to identify your anger triggers.
First, let’s look at an example of how uncontrollable anger can unfold and create
unwanted consequences.

Jenny Gets Angry

Jenny has been sober from alcohol for six weeks. She and her husband have been in
some conflict recently about the division of responsibilities between them. On
Saturday, their son Sammy has basketball practice at two o'clock. Jenny wants to
get together with some friends around one o'clock and she tells her husband that he
needs to take Sammy to practice. He refuses, saying that he has things to do. He
leaves the house before she can get a word in edgewise. Jenny is enraged. Thoughts
are racing through her head. He has no respect for me, or my time! If he keeps this up I will
never have a life. I’m going to let him have it! Unable to reach him, she leaves him a very
angry, screaming voice mail. Her son, after witnessing all of this, says, “Mommy,
why are you so mad at Dad? You don’t like going with me to basketball?” Jenny
feels very guilty and ashamed of her behavior. Suddenly she finds herself
experiencing a very strong craving for alcohol.

Thinking about Jenny’s situation, you can probably see the various consequences
of her inability to control her anger. She felt out of control; she reacted toward her
husband in a way that probably did not resolve anything; and in the process, she
unintentionally hurt her son’s feelings and modeled poor anger control. She ended up
feeling ashamed, and this affected her recovery by setting her up for a strong alcohol
craving.

Exercise 9.4: Anger Triggers

Identifying your personal anger triggers is the first step toward learning how to cope with
anger more effectively. Usually, anger triggers fall into one of five categories:

* People (such as Jenny’s husband)

187


The Addiction Recovery Skills Workbook

Places (such as the car, if you’re someone who experiences frustration and anger
management problems on the road)

Feelings (such as feeling rejected, ignored, restless, or impatient)

Thoughts (such as thoughts about the inefficiency of other people—for example, Why
is this line taking so long? | have somewhere to be!)

Physical sensations (such as physical discomfort from alcohol or drug withdrawal,
which can create irritability and anger)

Write down your anger triggers in each of these categories below:

Give It a Beat

Now that you are aware of your personal anger triggers, you need to learn to give it a
beat—to take a few moments to calm down when you feel angry and think about
next steps. You don’t need to react on impulse or “take the bait” from someone who
says or does something that provokes you to feel angry. Instead, you can choose to
remain in control, rise above it, and cope with it in such a way that you will be able
to look back and think, I’m proud of the way I handled that. This doesn’t mean that you
shouldn't fee! angry. Anger control is not about preventing the experience of anger; it
is about controlling your response to it. Here are some coping strategies that you can

try when you give it a beat:

190

Have an inner dialogue about it before you decide how to respond.
Try telling yourself one of the following phrases—whichever is the most
helpful to you:

* Ican keep my cool and remain in control of myself.
© It’s up to me to remain in control. I know I can do it.

* Ican stay relaxed and get through this in a way that I can feel good about in the
end.

* Ican’t control how other people act and feel. Even if the actions of others upset me,
I can only control my own behavior.

Be assertive. Tell the other person that you're feeling upset and you need
some time to gather your thoughts and feelings before you can talk about
it.

Leave the situation. Just as you may have to leave a triggering situation in
which you are vulnerable to relapse, if your anger is triggered and you're
concerned that you might not be able to control it, leaving the situation is
a perfectly reasonable coping strategy.

Focus on your breath. Relaxation and meditation strategies can be very
helpful to bring your nervous system back into rhythm when you are feeling
worked up.

Count to ten. This can buy you the time that you need to calm yourself
down so you don’t react in an out-of-control or impulsive manner.


Step 7: Conquer Challenging Emotions

Allow yourself to cry. If you need an emotional outlet, give yourself the
space and permission to do that. Crying is much healthier than lashing out
in anger at someone else.

When you've calmed yourself down in the moment, then you can begin to think

about how you can challenge angry thoughts. Use the assertive communication skills
that you practiced in chapter 4 to communicate about the situation that made you
angry in an effective manner that enables you to get your needs met.

Coming back to Jenny’s situation, let’s take a look at how she might challenge her
angry thoughts by considering the consequences of her behavior and coming up with
an inner dialogue that can help to lessen her angry feelings:

Triggering situation: Feeling that her needs were ignored by her husband. He refused
to take Sammy to basketball practice, which made her unable to carry out her social

plans.

Angry thoughts: He has no respect for me, or my time! If he keeps this up I will never have a
life. I'm going to let him have it!

Alternative responses:

It’s understandable that I'm angry; he knows that disregarding my requests like that
gets me worked up. But I won't let myself hang on to anger because of him.

I'll discuss a way to plan our weekends in advance when he comes home and I’ve
cooled down.

I'm going to make the best of the afternoon and take Sammy for ice cream after bas-
ketball practice.

I'm going to apologize to Sammy for losing my cool like that and try to talk with him
about healthier ways to express anger, so I can still set a good example.

I know that it’s okay to feel anger, but I'm going to do a mindfulness breathing medita-
tion for five or ten minutes now, until I feel calmer.

Using any of these alternative responses will help Jenny to feel less angry and to
build confidence in her ability to manage anger as it comes up. In this next exercise,
you will give some thought to your own anger and how you can plan to respond to
angry feelings differently.

Exercise 9.5: Changing Angry Behavior

In this exercise, you will think about a time when you were angry and reacted to your anger
in ways that were unhelpful. You will then come up with some alternative responses that you
could have used. Thinking this through can prepare you to use healthier strategies the next
time you feel angry.

Coping with Negative Emotions

So far in this chapter, you’ve been practicing cognitive strategies for managing
negative emotions—namely, identifying and challenging the thoughts that lead to
them. This can be a very effective approach. But sometimes, for various reasons, a
behavioral technique (in other words, doing something therapeutic rather than think-
ing your way through it) or a less time-intensive cognitive technique (like saying a
quick reassuring phrase to yourself) may be a better choice for you. Here, we review
a range of therapeutic strategies that you can try in the face of any negative feeling
that might be triggering for you, whether it’s anger, sadness, guilt, shame, anxiety, or
another emotion.

¢ Try using the five-minute SOBER breathing exercise that you learned in
chapter 7.

* Do something that relaxes you. A few ideas:
* Focus on your breathing for a few minutes.
* Go for a walk.
¢ Take a bath.

¢ Listen to some music.

193


The Addiction Recovery Skills Workbook

194

Try doing one of the pleasant activities you identified in exercise 8.3, in
chapter 8. Remember that pleasant activities have a positive impact on
your mood.

Exercise. This can be a great outlet for negative emotions and the nervous
energy that you might feel when you are worked up.

Call someone you feel comfortable talking to. You don’t even have to talk
about what’s bothering you if you don’t want to. Sometimes just hearing
the sound of a supportive voice can get you through a tough moment.

Go to a self-help meeting.

Say something reassuring to yourself. A lot of the time what gets and keeps
us anxious or down is the feeling that we can’t cope with things when they
get to a certain point. But this isn’t necessarily true. Try telling yourself:

* Ican get through this.
* Ican handle this.
* I can cope with whatever life sends my way.

* I’ve made it this far; I just need to take things one day at a time, one moment at
a time.

* I don’t have to say or do anything about how I am feeling right now. I can just get
through this moment, and figure out what to do later.

Give yourself some credit. You are working your way through a difficult
moment or day without drinking or using. You're using your intention to
get through this in a healthy way to prevent yourself from spiraling into a
relapse or reacting in some other self-destructive way that would make
matters worse for yourself.

Practice mindful acceptance. Sometimes, when circumstances that are
upsetting to you are out of your control, entering a mode of acceptance can


Step 7: Conquer Challenging Emotions

be the most therapeutic approach. Here are some things that you can tell
yourself to find your way to acceptance:

* This is just how it is right now.
* Even though I don’t like this, I can tolerate it.

* I’m not going to judge the way I’m feeling. This is my experience. Maybe I can
learn something from it.

Revisit Your Motivation

No matter what it is that triggers an urge to drink or use, reminding yourself of
the reasons that you are working so hard to stay sober can be a very effective tool to
keep you on track with your recovery goals. This is no different when it comes to
negative emotions. Go back to exercise 3.2 in chapter 3, Resolving Your Ambivalence,
in which you explored the benefits and drawbacks of quitting versus continuing to
drink or use. If you completed this exercise thoroughly, you should see something
about relief from depression, anxiety, or any other triggering negative emotion for you
as one of the benefits of continuing to drink or use. Now take a look at the drawbacks
you listed of continuing to drink or use, along with the benefits of quitting. Any time
you feel tempted by a negative emotion, you can revisit this exercise. After you've
thought carefully about your reasons for quitting, then rate your motivation for sobri-
ety on a scale from 0 to 10, with zero meaning that you are not motivated at all, and
10 meaning that you are as motivated as you can possibly be.

ie) 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

Not Motivated Somewhat Motivated Motivated Highly Motivated
Wherever you are on the scale, ask yourself what it would take to move one point
higher. Keeping your motivation strong—partly by reminding yourself of the reasons

you are going to all of this trouble to stay sober—will help you resist the temptation
to drink or use when you are feeling down.

195


The Addiction Recovery Skills Workbook

Wrap-up

Studies show that negative emotions are among the most common relapse triggers.
The great news is, the most useful techniques for coping with negative emotions are
the same as those that you've been using to cope with cravings to drink or use—such
as challenging your thoughts, practicing mindfulness, learning acceptance, and engag-
ing in pleasant activities. Now you just need to apply these strategies to your negative
thoughts and feelings, as you’ve been practicing by using the exercises in this chapter.

By this point you've learned all of the essential skills that you need to manage the
road to recovery. In the next and last chapter of this book, putting all of your hard
work together, you will reflect on all that you’ve learned and—based on what you've
observed to be the most helpful strategies—you will put together an integrated, per-
sonalized relapse prevention plan that you can use going forward in your recovery
process.

CHAPTER 10

Your Personalized
Recovery Plan

ou’ve come a long way since you started this workbook. You have been prac-

ticing a lot of skills to help keep you sober and to pave the way to find happi-

ness, pleasure, and emotional balance in your recovery. You understand the
way your addicted brain works. You've strengthened your rational brain repeatedly
with CBT skills, mindfulness training, motivational exercises, new sources of pleasure
to replace drugs and alcohol, and a deeper understanding of how your unique relapse
triggers lead you to drink or use. In this chapter, we're going to put all of the skills
you've learned together into a personalized recovery plan that will help you stay
happy, healthy, and sober in the long term.

There are a few ways that you will use the skills you've learned to prepare for long-
term recovery. First, you will need to be aware of your personal warning signs for
relapse, and be prepared with a plan for what to do if you or someone close to you
begins to notice these signs becoming apparent. Second, although the hope is that
you won't slip or relapse, given that most people who are in recovery do at one time
or another, you will need to prepare for how to handle a slip, to prevent it from
turning into a full-blown relapse. Finally, putting all of your hard work together, you
will reflect on all that you've learned in this workbook and, based on what you've
observed to be the most helpful strategies, you will put together an integrated, per-
sonalized relapse prevention plan that you can use going forward in your recovery
process.


The Addiction Recovery Skills Workbook

Staying One Step Ahead of a Relapse

The great news about where you are now, compared to when you started this work-
book, is that you know exactly what triggers you and makes you vulnerable. Equipped
with this knowledge, you're less likely to be blindsided by an urge to drink or use. You
just have to pay attention to what’s coming up ahead.

For at least the first six months of your recovery, one of the best ways to stay
ahead of a potential relapse is to sit down at the start of each week and take the time
to think about the days ahead. Do you know of any risky or potentially stressful situ-
ations coming up? (These could be family-related, work-related, or other situations
that might result in the urge to drink or use.) If so, you can plan how youre going to
handle them ahead of time. If you feel triggered, will you leave? Will you plan not to
stay very long to begin with, so as to avoid getting triggered? Will you use a medita-
tion technique? Maybe you'll bring someone with you who is sober. Or if it’s possible,
you'll consider avoiding that situation altogether.

These are just a few examples of plans that you can lay out if you take the time to
think about what’s coming up for you. It may be helpful to refer back to the Urge
Planner in chapter 6. Plan on completing this exercise on a weekly basis for as long
as you can (ideally, for the first six months of your recovery). You can discuss it with
your counselor or therapist, if you have one, and get some input as to how to plan for
potentially triggering situations.

Signs of Trouble

If you think back to the last time that you slipped or relapsed, there were probably
warning signs before you entered the situation in which you actually drank or used.
Recovery is not just about behaviors (such as avoiding risky situations, or going to
therapy or self-help meetings)—as you well know now, it is also a mindset.

As the strength of your motivation for recovery naturally moves up and down,
you may find yourself slipping out of the recovery mindset at times. Although this
does not necessarily mean that you are headed straight for a relapse, it is best to be
aware when it is happening so that you can take steps to renew your motivation and
get yourself back on track. In exercise 11.1, you'll find a list of some common warning
signs. These signs can relate to either your mindset or your behaviors. As you look
through this list, think about times when you've relapsed; in the days and even the
weeks before, you probably experienced some changes in the way you were thinking

198


Your Personalized Recovery Plan

about your recovery, or the way you were acting or feeling emotionally. Maybe you
didn’t realize at the time that these warning signs were there, but now as you look
back on it, things may become a little bit clearer.

Exercise 11.1: My Warning Signs of Relapse

Look at the list of warning signs below and place a check mark beside the ones that you can
identify with, or that you've observed in yourself prior to a relapse.

Stopping or cutting back your attendance in therapy or counseling

Thinking about ways that you might be able to drink or use without anyone
knowing about it

Fantasizing often about how good it would feel to drink or use, while blocking
out or thinking very little about the potential negative consequences

Stopping or cutting back your attendance in self-help groups, such as AA or
SMART Recovery

solating yourself

Placing yourself in risky situations

Avoiding talking about mixed feelings or doubts you have about staying sober
Starting to use a drug other than your “substance of choice”

Feeling intense negative emotions, such as depression, anxiety, anger, or
irritability
Feeling that you don’t fit in with others who are in recovery

Blaming other people for your problems

Having very few activities that are fun or enjoyable in your routine
Not sleeping well or not sleeping enough

Neglecting responsibilities, such as paying bills, doing household tasks, taking
care of loved ones, or getting to work or school

Avoiding talking about feelings of unhappiness

199


The Addiction Recovery Skills Workbook

Feeling hopeless about your ability to rebuild your life
eeping alcohol, drugs, or paraphernalia at home

Hanging on to phone numbers of dealers or people you used to use with

Lying

Rejecting help from others
Feeling bored or having lots of unstructured or unplanned time
Spending time with people who drink or use

Acting defensive when others around you express concern about your well-

being or recovery

Other relapse warning signs:

Now, looking back at the list, identify which you think are the top three signs
that you are at risk of relapse. You will need a plan for what you will do if you or
someone close to you points out any of these signs. Here are some examples of poten-
tial plans:

200

Discuss it with your therapist or counselor, if you have one.

Seek to start or resume therapy or counseling, if you're not currently
attending.

Consult with a psychiatrist to evaluate whether medications are needed to
manage any psychological symptoms (such as depression or anxiety).

Increase your attendance at self-help meetings.

Call your 12-step sponsor if you have one, or seek out a sponsor.


Your Personalized Recovery Plan

* Review relevant exercises in this workbook related to strengthening your
motivation, challenging your thoughts, and increasing pleasant activities.

* Initiate an exercise plan, or step up your existing one.

You might come up with other ideas. But this list can help you begin to think
about how you can respond to your warning signs.

Put a Stop to the Slip

You might remember our discussion about the difference between a “slip” and a
relapse. To review here briefly, the first time you drink or use after a period of being
sober or abstinent, it is called a “slip.” Although you may be committed to abstinence,
and it might be hard to imagine that you'd slip, studies of addiction have shown that

201


The Addiction Recovery Skills Workbook

the tendency to return to substance use after a period of sobriety is part of the illness
(NIDA 2010). So it is best to be prepared for the possibility that this could happen.

The important thing to remember is that your response to a slip makes all the
difference in terms of the impact it has on your recovery. A slip doesn’t have to set
you back tremendously, if you're willing to address it immediately by: (1) talking
about it with a counselor, therapist, or sponsor; (2) figuring out what went wrong;
and (3) putting safeguards into place to prevent it from progressing into a relapse. A
relapse happens when you allow a slip to lead to an extended period of days, weeks,
or longer during which you actively drink or use drugs. Here are some things that you
can tell yourself to prevent a slip from heading in the relapse direction:

¢ Ican leave the slip behind me as long as I don’t repeat it.

* Ican use the slip as a learning opportunity. If I understand why it happened, I can
prevent it from happening again.

¢ I may feel bad about it, but that will pass. As long as I get right back on the road to
recovery, without wasting any more time drinking or using, I will feel good about
myself again very soon.

Another important thing to remember is to catch yourself if you find that you are
getting into the spiraling lapse mindset. In chapter 5, we discussed how sometimes
when you experience a slip or a lapse, it can trigger dysfunctional thoughts like, I’ve
blown it. I'm a total failure. I'll never stay sober. I have nothing to lose by continuing to drink (or
use). Beware of the spiraling lapse frame of mind; it is a sure pathway from a slip to a
full-blown relapse. You can avoid it by recognizing it for what it is, and intentionally
bringing your thoughts into a more CBT-oriented mindset, in which you view the slip
as a learning opportunity that you can quickly move past.

Once you've preserved your recovery mindset, brought yourself out of the spiral-
ing lapse mode, accepted that the slip happened, and decided that you are ready to
put it behind you, there are a few more steps you can take to prevent any further drug
or alcohol use:

* Go back to chapter 3 and revisit your motivation to stay sober. Pay particu-
lar attention to exercises 3.2, on the benefits and drawbacks of quitting
versus continuing to drink or use, and 3.3, on ways to strengthen your
motivation. Understanding the importance of renewing your motivation
often is a key part of successful recovery and keeping your rational mind in
control.

202


Your Personalized Recovery Plan

¢ Learn from the situation. Find someone—preferably a therapist or coun-
selor—to review the sequence of events leading to the relapse and help you
figure out what went wrong. This will involve considering the following
questions:

* Were there any warning signs over the past few days, weeks, or months?

* Did you address the warning signs? If so, what more could you have
done? If not, why not?

* How did you end up in the situation in which you relapsed?
* What was the trigger?
* How did the relapse affect you?

* How can you cope more effectively the next time you are confronted
with a similar situation or trigger?

* Step up the support. A slip is a sign that one or more parts of your recovery
plan were not firmly in place. Sometimes stepping up the social or profes-
sional support for your recovery can help solidify your relapse prevention
program. This could take the form of:

* More involvement in self-help groups
* Getting into therapy or increasing the frequency of therapy

* More social contact with people in recovery (like having coffee with
sober friends, or making more efforts to connect with others who are in
recovery)

* Considering medication treatment for your addiction or mental health
if you aren't receiving any, or discussing a change to your current medi-
cation treatment with your provider.

Your Personalized Relapse Prevention Plan

Now that you’ve worked your way through all of the chapters and the exercises in
each one, you are well positioned to manage your recovery both now and in the long

203


The Addiction Recovery Skills Workbook

term. In each of the chapters, you’ve been trying new skills and, hopefully, making
mental notes about which of them have been most helpful to you.
In this section you're going to revisit these skills and mark off the ones that you

think you'd like to use, going forward in your recovery. Some of the skills are general
recovery lifestyle behaviors; they keep you feeling happy and balanced, reducing your
risk of a relapse. (Examples include doing pleasant activities, exercising, and commu-

nicating effectively with others.) Other coping skills that you've learned are more
specific to risky situations (like surfing the urge, the mindfulness-based SOBER
breathing exercise, and challenging red flag thoughts). Reflecting on the skills you’ve
learned in this program, place a check mark beside those that you found helpful:

Motivation Enhancing Skills

Thinking about what stage of change you're in, rating your current

motivation to quit (from 0 to 10), and thinking about what it would
take to move your motivation rating up by at least one point

Reviewing the benefits and drawbacks of continuing to drink or use,
as well as the benefits and drawbacks of quitting

Reviewing the problems that alcohol or drug use have caused in your
life

Thinking about what concerns you about your alcohol or drug use,
and what you can imagine happening if you were to continue drinking
or using

Thinking about how quitting has affected and will continue to affect
your life

Reviewing the reasons why you believe you have the ability to get and
stay sober

others and to refuse offers of alcohol or drugs

Expanding your social network in one or more ways
Keeping a schedule

Identifying and scheduling pleasant activities that are incompatible
with drinking and using

Rewarding yourself for following through with pleasant activities

Alcohol- and Drug-Specific Coping Skills

Identifying your triggers

Being aware of your red flag thoughts

Recognizing and challenging mistakes in thinking
Monitoring your triggers and cravings

Getting rid of all alcohol, drugs, and paraphernalia
Surfing the urge to cope with a craving
Distracting yourself to cope with a craving

Delaying the decision to drink or use by fifteen minutes to cope with
a craving

Using the Urge Planner to anticipate and plan for risky situations
Using mindfulness exercises to develop a meditation practice
Using the SOBER mindfulness exercise to cope with a craving
Practicing mindful acceptance

Getting involved (or more involved) in mutual self-help groups, like
AA or SMART Recovery

205


The Addiction Recovery Skills Workbook

Mood and Anger Management

Monitoring your mood and cravings
Monitoring your anxiety and cravings

Identifying and challenging negative thoughts that lead to anxiety and
depression

Identifying anger triggers

Now, you will list the skills in each category that you plan to use as your “go-to”
strategies in your personalized relapse prevention plan. Think about which exercises
have spoken the most to you and your personal experience. Also think about which
of the techniques you have found yourself using when you were not reading this
workbook, but just out living your life and navigating challenges in your recovery.

Acknowledgments

his book would not have been possible without the support and guidance of

many to whom I am deeply grateful. Several of my most influential teachers

throughout my training as a clinician and scientist enabled me to become the
expert that I am in the various therapy approaches to the treatment of addiction that
are integrated in this book, and I am deeply grateful to them: Bruce Overmier, Sandra
Brown, John McQuaid, and Tamara Wall. I am profoundly appreciative for the men-
torship of Thomas Mintz, who inspired me with his wisdom and knowledge about
how to synthesize my scientific expertise and clinical experience to form a book that
could reach addicted clients directly.

The idea that formed the basis of this book—that integrating the various evidence-
based therapeutic approaches to addiction treatment and providing them in a single
source could enable those with addictions to individualize their approach to recovery—
was born out of a series of conversations with Richard Rawson, to whom I owe an
enormous debt of gratitude for helping me form and crystallize my ideas, and for
fueling my passion for addiction science and treatment throughout my career.

I have valued greatly the professionalism and skills of Tesilya Hanauer and her
colleagues at New Harbinger, who contributed to the development and production of
this book, including Jess Beebe, Marisa Solis, and Angela Autry Gorden, as well as
freelance editor Susan LaCroix. To Héléne Chokron Garneau at UCLA, I extend a
special thank-you for her dedication to my clinical research and tireless efforts in the
process of assembling this workbook. I’d also like to gratefully acknowledge the help
and support of the agencies that have funded my research on developing and evaluat-
ing behavioral treatments for addictions and related conditions: the National Institute
on Drug Abuse and the National Institute on Alcoholism and Alcohol Abuse.



The Addiction Recovery Skills Workbook

It is a pleasure to thank the many clients I have worked with over the years who
have helped me understand the psychology of addiction and the struggles that are at
the core of recovery.

Finally, I am forever grateful to my family for their love and support throughout
the process of bringing this project to fruition; I know how lucky I am.

SELF-HELP

A seven-step program to help you
overcome drug and alcohol addiction

If you struggle with drugs or alcohol, seeking help is a positive first step toward recovery. You've
likely suffered a great deal as a result of your addiction, and you may have already learned that
there's no quick fix for managing the urge to drink or use. That's why understanding the cause of
your addiction—and the science behind your urges—is crucial for moving forward in your recovery.

In this workbook, you'll find evidence-based techniques fusing cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT),
motivational interviewing, and mindfulness-based relapse prevention to help you understand

the patterns of thoughts and actions that fuel your addiction, and to create your own unique
recovery plan. Whether you're already in treatment or have just admitted you have a problem, this
workbook can help you move past your addiction and start living the meaningful life you desire.

“A cutting-edge, comprehensive,
and interactive approach to the
science of addiction recovery,
written with great respect and
compassion for the reader.
Anyone struggling with the
demons of addiction will find
real help here, and hope.”

—Terri Cheney, author of the New York Times bestseller Manic

“Glasner-Edwards has taken
the very best of addiction
science and turned it into

common sense and step-by-step
instructions. ... A powerful and
practical tool to aid recovery.”

—A. Thomas McLellan, founder and chairman of the board of

the Treatment Research Institute, and former deputy director of
the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy
