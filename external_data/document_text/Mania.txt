Introduction

This guide is for people with bipolar disorder, their families and
anyone who wants to understand the basics of this illness and its
treatment and management. It is not a substitute for treatment from
a doctor or mental health care provider, but it can be used as a basis
for questions and discussion about bipolar disorder. This handbook
covers many aspects of bipolar disorder and answers frequently
asked questions. With respect to drug treatments, new medications
are continually being developed, and some current medications may
not yet have been available when this guide was published.

1 What is bipolar disorder?

Why is bipolar disorder called an
“illness”?

Everyone has ups and downs in mood. Feeling happy, sad and angry
is normal. Bipolar disorder (or manic-depressive illness, as it used to
be called) is a medical condition in which people have extreme mood
swings. Their moods may have nothing to do with things going on
in their lives. These swings do not only affect mood, they also affect
how people think, behave and function.

Bipolar disorder is no one’s fault. It does not come from a “weak”
or unstable personality. It is a medical disorder that can be treated.

How common is bipolar disorder?

You or someone you care about may have been diagnosed with
bipolar disorder. You may now feel alone in facing the problems
of the illness, but you are not alone. About one to two per cent of
adults worldwide suffer from bipolar disorder. Men and women.
are affected equally.


Bipolar disorder: An information guide

When does bipolar disorder begin?

More and more, the first signs of bipolar disorder are being recog-
nized in adolescence or early adulthood. Yet the younger the person
is when the symptoms first develop, the less typical the symptoms
may be. The symptoms may be mistaken for teenage distress or
rebellion, so bipolar disorder is often not diagnosed until adulthood.

In some women, bipolar disorder may appear during pregnancy or
shortly after it. Mania, or a “high,” after pregnancy occurs in only
about one mother in a thousand. Postpartum depression is more
common (see pages 5-9 for symptoms of mania and depression). If
you or someone you care about has developed depressive symptoms
after giving birth, and these symptoms are severe or last more than
two weeks, you or she should seek help.


2 The clinical features of
bipolar disorder

The episodes of bipolar disorder

Bipolar disorder is an episodic (that is, recurring) disorder. It typically
consists of three states:

+a high state, called mania

+a low state, called depression

+a well state, during which many people feel normal and
function well.

The manias and depressions may be either “pure” episodes (they
have only typical manic or depressive symptoms) or they may be
mixed episodes (they may consist of a mixture of both manic and
depressive symptoms at the same time). Traditionally, mixed epi-
sodes have been associated with the manic phase of the illness, so
terms such as “mixed mania” or “dysphoric mania” are often used
to describe mixed states.


Bipolar disorder: An information guide

Types of bipolar disorder

Some people experience manic (or mixed), depressed and well
phases during their illness. Such people are said to have bipolar-I
disorder. A milder form of mania is called “hypomania.” People
who have hypomania, depression and intervals without symptoms,
but no full manic phases, are said to have bipolar-II disorder.

Order and frequency of the various
states

The manic/hypomanic, mixed and depressive states usually do not
occur in a certain order, and their frequency cannot be predicted.
For many people there are years between each episode, whereas
others suffer more frequent episodes. Over a lifetime, the average
person with bipolar disorder experiences about 10 episodes of
depression and mania/hypomania or mixed states. As the person
ages, the episodes of illness often come closer together. Untreated
manias often last for two to three months. Untreated depressions
usually last longer, between four and six months.

RAPID CYCLING

About 20 per cent of people with bipolar disorder have four or more
(sometimes many more) episodes a year. People with four or more
episodes a year are said to be having rapid cycling, which is a sub-
type of bipolar disorder that needs specific treatment. We don’t know
for certain what causes rapid cycling. Sometimes, its occurrence may
be triggered by certain antidepressants, but how the antidepressant
causes rapid cycling is not clear. Sometimes stopping the antidepres-
sant may help the person to return to a “normal” cycling pattern.


3 The symptoms of
bipolar disorder

Mania

Sometimes, a person may seem abnormally and continuously high,

irritable or expansive for at least one week. If this change in mood is
accompanied by other symptoms (see below) the person may be in
a manic phase of bipolar disorder. Not everybody who enters a manic
phase feels happy or euphoric. Instead, a person may feel very irritable,
or may be terribly angry, disruptive and aggressive.

People in a manic phase do not have only mood symptoms. For a
manic episode to be diagnosed, they must also have at least three
of the following symptoms to an important degree:

+ Exaggerated self-esteem or feeling of grandeur: People feel invin-
cible or all-powerful; they believe they understand “how the world
works” or how to save it. They may feel they have a special mission
in life (e.g., that God has sent them or given them special powers).

+ Less need for sleep: People feel rested after just a few hours of sleep.
Sometimes they may not sleep at all for a few days or even weeks.


Bipolar disorder: An information guide

+ Increased talking: People may talk very quickly, too loudly and much
more than usual. They may like to tell jokes or rhyme words and
may become angry when interrupted. They may keep switching
topics and be unable to converse properly with others.

+ Flight of ideas or racing thoughts: People easily lose their train
of thought, and have trouble interacting because they are easily
distracted. They may be impatient with others who cannot follow
their fast thinking and changing plans and ideas.

+ Speeded-up activity: People may socialize more than usual at work
or school, or may be much more active, with seemingly boundless
energy. In the early manic phase, they may be productive, but as
symptoms worsen, people are more frantic in their activities and
start many projects without finishing them.

+ Poor judgment: People may not be able to control or plan how
they act. They may take part in unusual and risky activities without
realizing the harmful consequences (e.g., shopping sprees, bad
business choices and bad decisions). They may become more
sexually active and take less care in choosing their sexual partners.
This increased sexual activity may lead to unwanted pregnancies,
sexually transmitted diseases, guilt and disrupted relationships.

+ Psychotic symptoms: People may experience symptoms of psy-
chosis, such as delusions (beliefs that are not based in reality).
They may also have hallucinations—most often, they hear voices
that are not really there.


The symptoms of bipolar disorder

Hypomania

The symptoms of hypomania are less severe than those of mania,
but may still be disruptive. People may feel happy and have lots
of energy, but do not usually get into serious trouble. Hypomania
may progress to a full-blown manic episode or a severe depression,
and therefore needs treatment.

Mixed state

Some people do not always have “pure” manic or depressive
episodes. Instead, they may experience episodes in which manic
and depressive symptoms occur at the same time. This is called a
“mixed state.” For example, someone in a mixed state may think
and speak very rapidly. At the same time, the person may be very
anxious and have suicidal thoughts. Mixed states are hard to diag-
nose and are very painful for the individual.

Depression

Depression can take many forms, and it often comes out of nowhere.
For a major depressive episode to be diagnosed, the symptoms must
last for at least two weeks, and must be present most days and last

most of the day. Symptoms of depression in bipolar disorder include
at least five of the following:

Depressed mood: The mood state in depression differs substantially
from normal sadness. In fact, many people experiencing depression
say they cannot feel sadness, and many people cannot cry when
depressed. Being able to cry again often means the depression is
improving.


Bipolar disorder: An information guide

Marked loss of interest or pleasure in activities that used to be fun:
When people have just begun to feel depressed or are mildly de-
pressed, they can still enjoy things, and may also be distracted by
pleasurable activities. When people are severely depressed, they
lose these abilities.

Weight loss or weight gain: Many people lose weight when depressed,
partly because they lose their appetite. However, one subgroup feels
hungrier, and may develop a craving for carbohydrate-rich and fatty
foods. This results in weight gain. Metabolism may also increase or
slow down, depending on the type of depression; such changes in
metabolism can cause either weight loss or weight gain.

Sleep problems: Sleep disturbance is common in depression. Many
people suffer from insomnia: they have trouble falling asleep, wake
up often during the night or wake very early in the morning. People
do not see sleep as being restful, and they may wake up feeling
exhausted. Other people oversleep, especially during the day; they
are said to have “hypersomnia.”

Apathy or agitation: Many people with depression develop slowed-
down movement, speech or thinking. In severe cases, people with
depression may be unable to move, speak and respond to their
environment. For some people, the opposite happens, and they
are very agitated. They are tormented by a severe inner restless-
ness—they cannot sit still, they pace, they may wring their hands.
They may also show their agitation in other ways. People who feel
agitated often feel very anxious, too.

Loss of energy: People experiencing depression find it hard to com-
plete everyday chores. It takes them longer to perform at work or at
home because they lack energy and drive.


The symptoms of bipolar disorder

Worthlessness and guilt: When depressed, people may lack self-
confidence. They may not assert themselves, and they may be over-
whelmed by feelings of worthlessness. Many people cannot stop
thinking about past events. They obsess about having let others
down or having said the wrong things—and they feel very guilty.
In severe cases, the guilt may cause delusions; that is, people
feel sure that they have sinned and need to be punished for their
wrongdoings. Or they may believe that God is punishing them
for their past mistakes.

Inability to concentrate or decide: These symptoms may be so bad
that people cannot do simple tasks. They may have trouble deciding
on very small matters.

Suicidal thoughts: People who are depressed often think that life is
not worth living or that they would be better off dead. The risk of act-
ing upon these thoughts is high, and many people do try to commit
suicide when depressed.

Psychotic symptoms: Symptoms of psychosis in depression may
include false beliefs about being poor or being punished for past
sins. People may believe that they have a deadly disease, such as

cancer. They may also hear voices (auditory hallucinations) or may
see things that do not exist (visual hallucinations).

Depressive symptoms also often include:

* severe anxiety

+ worries about small matters

+ complaints about physical symptoms, including pain

+» many visits to the family doctor for various physical symptoms.


10

Bipolar disorder: An information guide

Other symptoms of a bipolar episode

Some people with bipolar disorder may have problems with move-
ment during their episodes. These disturbances of movement (mo-
tor symptoms) occur in up to 25 per cent of patients with depression
and up to 28 per cent of patients with mixed or pure manic episodes.
These motor problems—called catatonic symptoms—vary and may
include extreme physical agitation, slowness, or odd movements or
postures. Sometimes people can't be slowed down; others may move
so little that they refuse even to open their mouth to eat, drink or
speak. This is a serious risk to their physical health. In most cases,
people become free of catatonic symptoms after specific treatment.

There is a risk that people with catatonic symptoms may be mis-
diagnosed, because these symptoms have been traditionally associ-
ated with schizophrenia, rather than bipolar disorder.

Comorbidity and its importance

A comorbid disorder is an illness or medical condition that occurs
together with another illness or medical condition. Comorbid
conditions can occur with bipolar disorder—they can start either
before a bipolar illness or at the same time. Experts do not know
why some disorders co-occur frequently with bipolar disorder and
others do not. The severity of the comorbid condition may change
over a lifetime, and its symptoms may also vary as the bipolar
disorder changes.

For example, one of the most common comorbid conditions is

alcohol or other drug problems. People with an alcohol problem
may drink too much during mania, or they may experiment with
other drugs, because they feel free and they are impulsive. They


The symptoms of bipolar disorder n

may also use drugs during depressive phases, because they be-
lieve it helps them to feel less depressed. The same people may
not abuse alcohol or other drugs during their well phase.

Psychiatric conditions that often co-occur with bipolar disorder:

+ panic disorder

+ obsessive-compulsive disorder

+ binge eating disorder

+ substance abuse

+ attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder
+ borderline personality disorder

It is important to diagnose comorbidity in bipolar disorder. Comor-
bid conditions may cloud the clinical picture and complicate treat-
ment of bipolar disorder. Also, the comorbid conditions are often
so severe that they too need treating.


4 What causes bipolar
disorder?

Several factors are involved in causing bipolar disorder, and the
precise mechanism is not known. However, there is strong evidence
that biological factors, including genetics, play an important role.
This does not mean that a person has to inherit the genes: the genes
involved may be altered when a person is conceived.

Genes are the blueprint for all the body’s cells and their contents.
Scientists believe that changes to genes can lead to faulty proteins
being produced within brain cells, which may then result in bipolar
disorder. Researchers today are looking at genes themselves, as
well as various proteins that may be affected in bipolar disorder.
These include:

+ proteins involved in making neurotransmitters (“chemical
messengers” in the brain)
+ proteins that use neurotransmitters to make cells do something.

We do know that bipolar disorder is not caused by too much stress
or difficult family relationships. However, these factors may trigger
an episode in someone who already has the illness. Nor is bipolar
disorder a simple imbalance of neurotransmitters, such as serotonin
or dopamine. Yet neurotransmitters may be affected during a flare-
up of the illness.


What causes bipolar disorder?

What is a trigger for a bipolar episode?

Not all episodes can be related to any particular trigger, but many
can. Triggers are situations that can provoke either mania or depres-
sion in someone who has already had an episode of illness. Feeling
very stressed or continually losing sleep is an example of this kind of
trigger. Other triggers are chemical, and include antidepressants that
work “too well’ and result in mania; common medications, such as
steroids (for instance, prednisone used for treating asthma, arthritis,
etc.); and street drugs, such as cocaine and amphetamines.


5 Treatments for bipolar
disorder

Treatment of bipolar disorder includes biological treatments (e.g.,
medications) and psychosocial treatments (e.g., psychoeducation,
psychotherapy). Often both types of treatment are needed, but
usually biological treatment is needed first to bring symptoms
under control.

Biological treatments

Because bipolar disorder is an illness with a strong biological com-
ponent, the main forms of treatment are biological. These consist
mainly of medications, but also include other treatments, such as
light therapy (spending time every day under a specially designed
light box) electroconvulsive therapy (ect) and transcranial magnetic
stimulation (rms), which is being researched as an alternative to Ecr.

MEDICATIONS

Some of the information in this section is summarized from the
CAMH pamphlet series Understanding Psychiatric Medications. The
pamphlets are designed to help people better understand and make


Treatments for bipolar disorder 15

choices about psychiatric drugs. They discuss what the drugs are
used for, the different types and names of drugs, their effects and
their place in the treatment of mental health problems. An online
version is available at www.camh.ca.

Medications are the cornerstone of treatment in bipolar disorder—
they are needed to restore and promote wellness, and to prevent the
return of symptoms. Several types of medications are commonly
prescribed for bipolar disorder. Finding the right medication and
the right dose for you will require monitoring and discussion with
your doctor.

Bipolar disorder symptoms tend to return if the disorder is not
treated. Most people who are untreated will experience another
episode within a couple of years. Medications not only treat symp-
toms but also prevent their return. People are much more likely
to stay well if they remain on medications. Recommendations for
maintenance, or longer-term, treatment depend on the type of ill-
ness. For some people, who have a mild single episode that is not
very impairing, staying on medications for one or two years may
work. For most other people, longer-term treatment is recommend-
ed. In many cases, treatment may be indefinite. Bipolar disorder is
potentially a chronic medical condition.

Sometimes, people with bipolar disorder may feel well for a long
time. When this happens, it is possible that the illness has entered
into a quiet period. Or it may mean that the medication is success-
fully preventing symptoms. In either situation, it is important to
keep taking medication. If a person ends the treatment, there is
an 80 per cent risk of relapse within two years. Relapse may occur
even after many years of stability.

Some people worry about becoming addicted to medications, or
experiencing a change in personality. The main treatments for


16

Bipolar disorder: An information guide

bipolar disorder are mood stabilizers, antidepressants and anti-
psychotics. These medications are not addictive and there is no
evidence that they change personality. However, some anti-anxiety
drugs carry a risk of addiction if taken regularly for more than a
few weeks.

Some of the medications used to treat bipolar disorder may have
side-effects. Many of these side-effects lessen with time, and others
can be relieved with help from a doctor. The doctor will monitor
side-effects and the medication dose, and will sometimes make
other checks. With these checks in place, the risk for long-term
physical complications from the medications is low. The risks of
living with untreated bipolar disorder are much greater.

Medications for bipolar disorder fall into two broad categories—
mood stabilizers and adjunct medications. Adjunct medications
are other medications that can be used to treat specific symptoms,
such as depression, poor sleep, anxiety and psychotic symptoms.
Adjunct medications include antidepressants, anxiolytics (anti-
anxiety medications), and antipsychotics (formerly called neuro-
leptics). These medications are often only used for the short term,
until the mood stabilizers take their full effect. However, they can
also be used in combination with mood stabilizers as longer-term
treatments for bipolar disorder.

People with bipolar disorder often require more than one medica-
tion. The treatment of other chronic medical conditions such as
diabetes or epilepsy often requires a combination of medications.

Mood stabilizers

Mood stabilizers are medicines that help reduce mood swings.
They also help prevent manic and depressive episodes. The oldest
and most studied of the mood stabilizers is lithium, a naturally
occurring element in the same chemical family as sodium. Many


Treatments for bipolar disorder

drugs that were first developed as anticonvulsants to treat epilepsy
also act as mood stabilizers. These include carbamazepine (Tegretol),
divalproex (Epival) and lamotrigine (Lamictal). Gabapentin (Neu-
rontin) and topiramate (Topamax) are also anticonvulsants that
may act as mood stabilizers, although they are usually only given
in addition to other medications.

Some people may be prescribed more than one type of mood stabi-
lizer to take in combination.

How mood stabilizers work is not fully understood; however, it is
thought that the drugs work in different ways to bring stability and
calm to areas of the brain that have become overstimulated and
overactive, or to prevent this state from developing.

The side-effects of mood stabilizers vary depending on the type
of medication. With some medications, side-effects are kept to a
minimum through regular monitoring of the level of the drug in
the blood. Some people experience no side-effects. Others may find
the side-effects distressing. Side-effects usually lessen as treatment
continues. If side-effects are not mild and tolerable, let your doctor
know as soon as possible.

LITHIUM

Lithium (Carbolith, Duralith, Lithane, Lithium Carbonate, Lithium
Citrate) is found in nature in some mineral waters and is also pres-
ent in small amounts in the human body. Lithium is used to treat
mania and to prevent further episodes of mania and depression.
There is increasing research evidence that lithium protects brain
cells from the inflammation that occurs in the brains of people
with bipolar disorder.

Common side-effects of lithium include increased thirst and urina-
tion, nausea, weight gain and a fine trembling of the hands. Less


18

Bipolar disorder: An information guide

common side-effects can include tiredness, vomiting and diarrhea,
blurred vision, impaired memory, difficulty concentrating, skin
changes (e.g., dry skin, acne) and slight muscle weakness. These
effects are generally mild and fade as treatment continues. If, how-
ever, any of these effects are severe, they should be reported to your
doctor immediately. Thyroid and kidney function can be affected
by lithium in some people, and must be monitored regularly by
your doctor.

DIVALPROEX, VALPROIC ACID OR VALPROATE

The differing names for this anticonvulsant medication reflect the
various ways it is formulated. Divalproex (and its various forms) is
used when people have frequent mood swings or when they don't
respond to lithium. Brand names include Depakene and Epival.

Common side-effects of divalproex include drowsiness, dizziness,
nausea and blurred vision. Less common side-effects are vomiting
or mild cramps, muscle tremor, mild hair loss, weight gain, bruis-
ing or bleeding, liver problems and, for women, changes in the
menstrual cycle.

CARBAMAZEPINE

Carbamazepine (Tegretol) is another anticonvulsant. It is used for
mania and mixed states that do not respond to lithium or when the
person is irritable or aggressive.

Common side-effects of carbamazepine include dizziness, drowsi-
ness, blurred vision, confusion, muscle tremor, nausea, vomiting
or mild cramps, increased sensitivity to sun, skin sensitivity and
rashes and poor co-ordination.

A rare but dangerous side-effect of carbamazepine is reduced blood
cell counts. People who take this drug should have their blood
monitored regularly for this effect. Soreness of the mouth, gums


Treatments for bipolar disorder

or throat, mouth ulcers or sores, and fever or flu-like symptoms can
be a sign of this effect and should be reported immediately to your
doctor. If carbamazepine is the cause of these symptoms, they will
go away when the medication is stopped.

Oxcarbazepine (Trileptal), a closely related drug, may have fewer
side-effects and drug interactions than carbamazepine, but is not
as well studied for bipolar disorder.

LAMOTRIGINE
Lamotrigine may be the most effective mood stabilizer for depression
in bipolar disorder, but is not as helpful for mania.

The starting dose of lamotrigine should be very low and increased
very slowly over four weeks or more. This approach decreases the
risk of a severe rash—a potentially dangerous side-effect of this drug.

Common side-effects of lamotrigine include fever, dizziness, drowsi-
ness, blurred vision, nausea, vomiting or mild cramps, headache
and skin rash. Although it is rare, a severe skin rash can occur with
lamotrigine. Any rashes that begin in the first few weeks of treatment
should be reported to your doctor.

Antidepressant medications

Antidepressants are medications that were originally found to be
useful in treating depression, and more recently have often been
found helpful to treat anxiety disorders.

Antidepressants are thought to work primarily by affecting the con-
centration of chemicals called neurotransmitters in the brain. Key
neurotransmitters that are affected include serotonin, norepineph-
rine, and dopamine. While antidepressants can be used in bipolar
disorder during depression episodes, they must be used with caution


20

Bipolar disorder: An information guide

since they can also cause a switch into mania and may precipitate a
cycle of frequent mood episodes (rapid cycling).

There are several classes of antidepressants; within each class there
are many individual medications. The different types of antidepres-
sants are listed below in the order in which they are most commonly
prescribed.

SELECTIVE SEROTONIN REUPTAKE INHIBITORS (ssRis)

This group of drugs includes fluoxetine (Prozac), paroxetine (Paxil),
fluvoxamine (Luvox), citalopram (Celexa), escitalopram (Cipralex)
and sertraline (Zoloft). ssRis are usually the first choice for treat-
ment of depression and anxiety problems.

SEROTONIN AND NOREPINEPHRINE REUPTAKE INHIBITORS (SNRIs)
This class of medications includes venlafaxine (Effexor), duloxetine
(Cymbalta) and desvenlafaxine (Pristiq).

NOREPINEPHRINE AND DOPAMINE REUPTAKE INHIBITORS (NDRIs)
The medication available in this class is bupropion (Wellbutrin,
Zyban). When used to treat depression, it is often given for its
energizing effects, in combination with other antidepressants.

NORADRENERGIC AND SPECIFIC SEROTONERGIC ANTIDEPRESSANTS
(NASSAs)

Mirtazapine (Remeron), the medication available in this class, is the
most sedating antidepressant.

CYCLICS

This older group includes amitriptyline (Elavil), maprotiline
(Ludiomil), imipramine (Tofranil), desipramine (Norpramin),
nortriptyline (Novo-Nortriptyline) and clomipramine (Anafranil).


Treatments for bipolar disorder

Because these drugs tend to have more side-effects than the newer
drugs, they are not often a first choice for treatment.

MONOAMINE OXIDASE INHIBITORS (maols)

MAOIs, such as phenelzine (Nardil) and tranylcypromine (Parnate),
were the first class of antidepressants. Maots are effective, but they
are not often used because people who take them must follow a
special diet. A newer Mao, moclobemide (Manerix), can be used
without dietary restrictions; however, it may not be as effective as
other Maots.

ANTI-ANXIETY MEDICATIONS.

Anxiety is common in bipolar disorder. Sleep disturbance is also
very frequent during an acute episode. Benzodiazepines, a family of
medications with mild sedating ability, are often prescribed. Many
types of benzodiazepines are available in Canada. All benzodiaz-
epines work the same way; however, the intensity and duration of
their effects vary. Benzodiazepines may be used for short periods
without causing addiction.

The benzodiazepines most commonly used to treat anxiety are
clonazepam (Rivotril), alprazolam (Xanax) and lorazepam (Ativan).
Clonazepam is particularly useful for treating the excessive energy
and reduced sleep of hypomania.

Benzodiazepines used for the treatment of insomnia include loraz-
epam (Ativan), nitrazepam (Mogadon), oxazepam (Serax), temaze-
pam (Restoril), triazolam (Halcion) and flurazepam (Dalmane).

Another drug used for insomnia is zopiclone (Imovane). This drug
is similar to benzodiazepines and has similar side-effects. Zopiclone
may have less abuse potential than some benzodiazepines; however,
people can still become addicted to this drug.

Bipolar disorder: An information guide

Antipsychotic medications

Antipsychotic medications are commonly used in bipolar disorder.
These medications have powerful sedating effects, which help con-
trol mania, and can treat psychotic symptoms such as delusions of
grandeur or persecution, and hallucinations. Antipsychotic medi-
cations are generally divided into two categories: first generation
(typical) and second generation (atypical). Most people who take
antipsychotics over a longer term are now prescribed the second-
generation drugs.

SECOND-GENERATION (ATYPICAL) ANTIPSYCHOTICS

Medications available in this class include risperidone (Risperdal),
quetiapine (Seroquel), olanzapine (Zyprexa), ziprasidone (Zeldox),
paliperidone (Invega), aripiprazole (Abilify) and clozapine (Clozaril).
Clozapine is exceptional in that it often works even when other
medications have failed; however, because it requires monitoring
of white blood cell counts, it is not the first choice for treatment.

FIRST-GENERATION (TyPICAL) ANTIPSYCHOTICS

These older medications include chlorpromazine (once marketed
as Largactil), flupenthixol (Fluanxol), fluphenazine (Modecate),
haloperidol (Haldol), loxapine (Loxapac), perphenazine (Trilafon),
pimozide (Orap), trifluoperazine (Stelazine), thiothixene (Navane)
and zuclopenthixol (Clopixol).

Newer medical treatments

Many of the newest medications used as mood stabilizers for bipolar
disorder were first developed as anticonvulsants (epilepsy treatments).
They include divalproex, carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, lamotrigine,
topiramate and gabapentin. There is variable evidence for the effec-

tiveness of these medications; divalproex and lamotrigine have been

investigated more thoroughly than the others.


Treatments for bipolar disorder 23

Two other drugs, ketamine and scopolamine, administered intra-
venously are being investigated for their antidepressant effect in
bipolar disorder.

It is helpful to ask your doctor about new and emerging treatments
for bipolar disorder. In some university medical centres, it is also
possible to participate in clinical trials of new treatments.

ELECTROCONVULSIVE THERAPY

Electroconvulsive therapy (Ect), also referred to as “shock therapy,”
is perhaps the most controversial and misunderstood of psychiatric
treatments, due in part to sensationalized and misleading depictions
of the treatment in the popular media. In fact, ecr is a highly effec-
tive and safe treatment for both the depressive and manic phases of
bipolar disorder, and is sometimes used as a long-term maintenance
treatment to prevent recurrence of illness after recovery.

ect does not resemble the shock therapy portrayed in films such
as One Flew over the Cuckoo’s Nest. Now patients are given muscle
relaxants and a general anesthetic before a mild electrical current
is administered to one or both sides of the brain. There is minimal
visible movement in the patient during the procedure. Usually the
treatments are administered three times a week over three to four
weeks, for a total of eight to 12 treatments. For longer-term main-
tenance treatment, the treatments may be spread out, for example,
once a month, and continued for as long as the patient and doctor
feel is appropriate. Ecr is usually given to hospitalized inpatients,
but outpatients can receive EcT as well.

Side-effects
Patients may have a headache or jaw pain on awakening after Ecr,
usually requiring only a mild painkiller such as acetaminophen


24

Bipolar disorder: An information guide

(Tylenol). Some loss of recent memory or problems with concen-

tration usually occur during treatment (e.g., patients may not recall
what they had for supper the night before the treatment), but these
symptoms improve quickly after the course of Ect is finished, over

a few weeks. Some patients report mild memory problems persist-
ing much longer after ecr treatment has been completed.

Uses of ect in bipolar disorder

ect is the most effective and possibly the fastest-acting treatment
for severe depression, and is particularly helpful for people who
are highly agitated or suicidal, or those with psychotic or catatonic
symptoms. Some people receive Ecr early in their episode of illness
because of the urgency of their situation or their particular symp-
toms, while for other patients ecr may be used only after various
medications have failed. ecr works well for severe mania as well.

While Ecr is highly effective at ending an episode of depression or
mania, the benefits may not last more than a few weeks or months
following treatment. Therefore after a course of ECT, patients usually
start or continue treatment with mood stabilizers and/or other
medication. Maintenance Ecr may be used when medications have
not prevented a recurrence of the illness, or for patients who cannot
tolerate the side-effects of medication.

TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION

Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMs) involves a series of short
magnetic pulses to the brain to stimulate nerve cells. rms is being
tested, but its effectiveness has not yet been proven. rms is being

investigated as an alternative treatment to Ect, but its effectiveness
is not yet proven. Unlike Ecr, the treatment is carried out without
the need for an anesthetic or muscle relaxant.


Treatments for bipolar disorder

COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE TREATMENTS

Some people with bipolar disorder seek non-conventional treatments,
often as an adjunct to complement conventional treatments rather
than as an alternative. Examples of complementary treatments include
herbal medicines, acupuncture, homeopathy, naturopathy, medita-
tion, yoga and Ayurveda. A number of nutritional supplements and
vitamins are also available.

Many of these treatments have not been thoroughly tested. St. John’s
wort has been shown to have some antidepressant effect for mild
to moderate unipolar depression (depression without mania). In
people with bipolar disorder, however, there is the possibility that it
may cause a switch from depression to mania. St. John’s wort may
also interact with a number of conventional medications.

If you are interested in herbal remedies, it is important to talk to
your doctor. It is helpful to have a doctor who is knowledgeable
about complementary and alternative therapies, because these can
interact with other medications you may be taking.

Omega-3 fatty acids (found in fish oils and some other foods) are
anti-inflammatory, and diets high in omega-3 are linked with lower
rates of depression. There is some evidence that omega-3 fatty acids
may be helpful in bipolar depression.

Some people find that practices such as yoga, tai chi and meditation
can aid with the control of anxiety and depression.

Physical activity

Physical activity or exercise has been shown to have antidepressant
effect. Regular physical activity—even just walking for 30 minutes
a day—has profound effects for physical and mental health. Exer-

25


26

Bipolar disorder: An information guide

cise has also been shown to increase the size of the hippocampus,
a part of the brain concerned with memory.

Psychosocial treatments

Psychosocial treatments include psychoeducation, psychotherapy,
support groups and rehabilitation.

PSYCHOEDUCATION

Psychoeducation is a process through which people learn about
bipolar disorder, and also have an opportunity to talk about their
feelings related to living and coping with the disorder. For example,
it is common for people learning about their illness to experience
strong feelings of fear or denial. Often, talking openly about these
feelings helps people to deal with them and better adhere to a treat-
ment plan that makes sense to them. Psychoeducation can occur
in groups or in individual counselling with a doctor, social worker
or other mental health care provider. When psychoeducation is
offered in a group format it is usually time-limited (8 to 12 sessions)
and each session focuses on a different aspect of managing bipolar
disorder (for example, signs and symptoms, stress management
and problem solving).

Psychoeducation also helps family members or partners under-
stand what the affected person is going through. They learn about
the symptoms of bipolar disorder, its treatment, what they can do
to be helpful, and the limitations to the help that they can offer.
The family can meet with the treating doctor, or attend a family
support and education group.


Treatments for bipolar disorder

Finally, psychoeducation helps people with bipolar disorder and
their families to deal with their concerns about the stigma of mental
illness. Although public education in recent years has raised aware-
ness, there are still many people who do not understand mental
illness, and feel uncomfortable when it is discussed. It is important
that people with bipolar disorder, along with their families, have a
safe place to discuss this issue and decide what information they
wish to share outside of the family.

PSYCHOTHERAPY

Psychotherapy is a general term used to describe a form of treat-
ment that is based on talking work done with a therapist. The
aim is to relieve distress by discussing and expressing feelings, to
help change attitudes, behaviour and habits that may be unhelpful,
and to promote more constructive and adaptive ways of coping.
Successful psychotherapy depends on a supportive, comfortable
relationship with a trusted therapist. Psychiatrists, social workers,
psychologists and other mental health providers are trained in
various models of psychotherapy and work in hospitals, clinics
and private practice.

There are many different models of psychotherapy. They fall into two
general categories: short-term and long-term. Short-term therapies
are structured and focus on current, rather than childhood, issues.

On average, the treatment lasts for between 1o and 20 sessions. In

short-term therapies, the therapist takes an active role in guiding the
discussions. Long-term therapy is less structured, and can last for a
year or more. The person has the opportunity to talk about a variety
of concerns related to both past and present-day issues. In this model,
the therapist is less directive and gives minimal advice, guiding the
client instead toward his or her own answers. Psychotherapy is a

very helpful treatment. For bipolar disorder, though, it only works as

27


28

Bipolar disorder: An information guide

an add-on to medications, not as a substitute. Every patient should
get some supportive therapy that involves not only managing medi-
cation, but also dealing with the various problems that a person with
bipolar disorder may experience. Practical suggestions and emotional
support are the main features of supportive therapy.

Cognitive-behavioural therapy

Cognitive-behavioural therapy (cB) is an example of a short-term
structured psychotherapy that has worked well for many other dis-
orders. It is based on the idea that deeply held beliefs or thoughts
influence how we look at ourselves and the world, and have a strong
influence on our mood and behaviour. For instance, if we are de-
pressed and think no treatment will help, then we might not bother
to seek treatment. This almost guarantees that we will feel worse.
Cognitive therapy attempts to identify and change such thoughts
and to improve mood and functioning. It is now being tested in
bipolar disorder. The early results are promising, both in prevent-
ing future episodes and in treating depression.

Anxiety is common in bipolar disorder, and cognitive-behavioural
therapy may be very helpful for more severe anxiety problems,
such as panic attacks. It may in fact be needed, because the antide-
pressants that are also sometimes used to treat anxiety disorders
may provoke manic episodes.

Insight-oriented or psychodynamic psychotherapy
Insight-oriented or psychodynamic psychotherapy is an example of
a long-term, unstructured psychotherapy. This therapy reduces dis-
tress by helping a person gain insight into the underlying motives
of his or her overall behaviour. While this is not a specific treatment
for bipolar disorder, it can be very helpful because increased self-
knowledge and awareness leads to more effective management of
the illness.


Treatments for bipolar disorder

Group therapy

Historically, group therapy has been used successfully to provide

elements of support and psychoeducation. Cognitive therapy may
also be provided in a group. However, group cognitive therapy has
not yet been tested for people with bipolar disorder.

Family and couple therapy

Family and couple therapy can help address problems that may have
existed before the illness and have become highlighted, or to deal
with issues that have arisen as a result of the illness. The timing,
however, is very important. During an acute episode, the family or
spouse should be given only support and education. Formal family
or marital therapy should wait until the person is more stable.

PEER SUPPORT GROUPS

Peer support groups can be very important to treatment. A peer
support group is a group of people who all have bipolar disorder.
These people can accept and understand one another, and can share
their struggles in a safe, supportive environment. Group members
usually develop a strong bond among themselves. People who have
recently been diagnosed with bipolar disorder can benefit from the
experiences of others. These groups are usually organized through
the local chapters of the Mood Disorders Association (see page 66
for more information). Although these groups are often called self:
help, peer support actually offers a type of help called mutual aid.

Hospitalization

During severe episodes of depression or mania, some people with
bipolar disorder may need to be hospitalized. Hospitalization is
needed if the illness is out of control and is putting a person at risk

29


30

Bipolar disorder: An information guide

of serious consequences—for example, through aggressive behav-
iour, risk-taking, failing to look after his or her own basic needs, or
suicidal tendencies.

VOLUNTARY VERSUS INVOLUNTARY ADMISSIONS

Patients are usually admitted to hospital voluntarily. This means
that they:

+ agreed to enter the hospital
«are free to leave hospital at any time.

However, in most places, the law also allows any doctor to admit
a person to hospital involuntarily. This means the person may not
agree that he or she needs help, and does not want to be in the
hospital. This can happen if the doctor believes there is a serious
risk that:

+ the person will physically harm himself or herself
+ the person will physically harm someone else.

If no doctor has seen the person, families also have the option of
asking a justice of the peace to order a psychiatric assessment, and
must provide convincing evidence that the person's illness represents
a danger to himself or herself, or to others.

Laws protect the rights of people who are admitted involuntarily.
For instance, a rights advisor will visit. The rights advisor will en-
sure that the person has the chance to appeal the involuntary status
before an independent board of lawyers, doctors and laypeople.

The police are sometimes needed to help to get a person to hos-
pital. Family members may agonize over whether to involve the


Treatments for bipolar disorder

police. They often feel very guilty about calling the police, even if
the police are needed to protect the person's life. Remember, when
people threaten suicide, they are usually pleading for help. They
are taken seriously. Suicidal thinking is often a temporary feeling.
When a person feels suicidal, he or she needs to be kept safe.

INPATIENT TREATMENT

A typical hospital stay may be anywhere between a few days and
several weeks. Usually patients are expected (or required, if they
are involuntary) to remain on the psychiatric unit for the first few
days of their stay. As they recover they may be granted increasing
privileges to visit other parts of the hospital or to walk outside. Later
they will be given passes to go home overnight or for the weekend.

Patients participate in a variety of group educational and therapeutic
programs, as well as individual sessions with medical, nursing and
other professional staff. Medications may be changed or doses ad-
justed, and families may be interviewed by medical or social work
or other staff.

Discharge planning begins immediately following admission to
hospital. Patients should expect to leave hospital as soon as rea-
sonable follow-up arrangements are in place and their symptoms
have improved enough to ensure they are able to function safely
and care for themselves at home. Staying in hospital after symp-
toms have improved may not benefit the person. It may in fact
cause difficulties by reducing the person’s connection to family
and social supports, and possibly undermining his or her inde-
pendent living skills.

31


6 Recovery and relapse
prevention

The goal in treating bipolar disorder is to help people get well again.
This includes:

+ treating symptoms until they no longer cause distress or problems
+ improving work and social functioning
+ reducing the risk of relapse.

The process of recovery

Some people may recover quickly from a manic, hypomanic, mixed
or depressive episode. For many others, recovery is more gradual.
Often, it takes a few months for a person's functioning to return to

familiar levels, even if symptoms of the most recent episode have

ended completely.

The time needed to recover often frustrates people with bipolar
disorder. This is especially true for people who expect a lot of them-
selves, who may feel demoralized by the delay. As a result, people
sometimes rush back into a full or even increased range of activities.
They may be trying to convince themselves and others that they are
fully recovered. But this “flight into health’ often overwhelms and


Recovery and relapse prevention

exhausts them. Just as you would increase activities gradually if you
were recovering from a broken leg, a gradual increase in activities
after a bipolar episode allows you to slowly take on responsibilities
and build self-confidence.

Remember that recovery is a process, not a single event. After a
bipolar episode, people often feel fragile, vulnerable and at risk of
more episodes. These feelings are a normal part of the recovery phase.
It takes some time before a person's confidence and performance
return to normal. At first, you should ease yourself into familiar
activities and have modest expectations. Predict that when you
return to activities such as socializing and going to school or work,
you will probably feel anxious. Allow yourself to make mistakes.
A social worker, occupational therapist or nurse can help plan a
strategy for recovery that might include volunteer activities, leisure
interests, school courses, and part-time or eventually full-time work.

Preventing relapse and promoting
wellness

At this time there is no cure for bipolar disorder, and people with the
disorder are at risk of further episodes. It is important to use periods of
wellness as an opportunity to actively prevent relapse. Bipolar disorder,

like illnesses such as diabetes, requires you to pay attention to how

you are feeling, so you can catch early warnings of a possible relapse

and possibly prevent a full episode.

Many people with bipolar disorder can benefit from counselling, psy-
chotherapy or meeting with an occupational therapist, social worker

or nurse. Using such resources can help you find coping strategies
to reduce symptoms, cope effectively with day-to-day stress and lower

33


34

Bipolar disorder: An information guide

the risk of recurrence. Health care providers should recommend
treatment tailored to your particular situation.

The following tips may help you prevent relapse and have a healthy
lifestyle.

1. Become an expert on your illness. Read as much as you can about
bipolar disorder and its treatment; if there is something you do
not understand, ask your mental health care providers.

2. Live healthily. Do not use alcohol or other drugs, because they
increase your risk of relapse. Eat a healthy diet, and exercise regu-
larly (it can have a positive effect on mood).

If you are struggling with falling asleep or staying asleep, it is
important for you to develop good sleep routines. Repeating these
routines each night can help restore better sleep patterns. Try to
go to bed at the same time each night. Avoid stimulating activi-
ties close to bedtime; plan on paying bills, completing work or
having important discussions earlier in the day. Many people find
that relaxation exercises, easy reading or a warm, non-caffeinated
beverage just before retiring are ways to promote a relaxed state of
mind. Expect that it will take you some time to fall asleep, and try
not to anticipate sleep problems, as this will add to your anxiety.
For some people, a sleep medication provides relief and allows
them the much-needed rest they have been deprived of.

. Continue to take medication until your doctor advises you oth-

we

erwise. Often, people begin to feel better and stop taking their
medication. Relapse is more likely if medication is discontinued
too soon. Recommendations for maintenance, or longer-term,
treatment depend on the type of illness. For some people, who
have a mild single episode that is not very impairing, staying
on medications for one or two years may work. For most other


Recovery and relapse prevention

people, longer-term treatment is recommended. In many cases,
treatment may be indefinite.

4. You can’t avoid stress, so find strategies to better cope with
stress. Many people with bipolar disorder tend to use only one
coping strategy. For example, they hide their worries and avoid
dealing with problems. This may work in some cases, but not
in others. Where possible, try different strategies. Deal with some
problems as they happen. Avoiding them allows stress to build
up. Be realistic about your stress-breaking point. Work toward
recognizing what aspects of relationships in your life might be
unhealthy and, if possible, try to avoid situations that may trigger
relapse.

. Avoid isolating yourself and maintain social support. Some people
with bipolar disorder tend to spend too much time alone. This can
add to their feeling depressed, demoralized and sad. Strong social
networks and social support can serve as a buffer against these
feelings. Try to avoid spending too much time alone, and work
toward maintaining contact with your social network.

wu

Whom you tell about your illness is a very personal choice. While
the stigma of mental illness is much less than it once was, it
remains a concern for many people. As a buffer against relapse,
however, it is important to have at least one person you can rely
on and you can confide in. Along with family and professional
support, many people with bipolar disorder find that peer sup-
port groups are a valuable part of their social network.

6.Try to develop a balanced life. It might seem easy at first to escape
from your depression by focusing entirely on one area, such as
work or a hobby. Eventually, however, this coping strategy may
not work, and you will need to develop other aspects of your life.
It is important to keep in contact with all the facets of your life,

35


36

Bipolar disorder: An information guide

such as school, work or volunteer activities, family and friends,
and hobbies. As you recover, investing energy in several areas will
help you develop a more balanced and satisfying life, which will
help you to avoid relapse.

7. Monitor your symptoms closely. Many people with bipolar disor-
der have a consistent pattern of symptoms across episodes. For
example, some people learn to recognize the early phase of an
impending relapse through signs such as needing less sleep, be-
coming irritable, or feeling that they no longer need medication.
Monitoring such signs closely and seeking medical attention can
stop a full-blown episode developing. Often, a mood diary or mood
charting app can help. Most healthy people experience a variety of
feelings that change from day to day—not all shifts in your mood
are due to bipolar disorder. (See also “Recognizing and responding
to early warning signs and triggers,” on p. 39.)

8. Identify family and friends as support. Insight is commonly lost
early in an impending episode. It can be helpful if friends or fam-
ily can recognize typical bipolar symptoms; they can help you in
seeking treatment if necessary.

Practical aspects of recovery

An episode of either depression or mania usually disrupts daily
routines as well as work, school and home life. People may feel that
life will never be the same. They may also feel unable to assume
their previous responsibilities and involvements. These feelings
are natural and understandable. Yet, once they are properly stabi-
lized on medication, most people with bipolar disorder can return
to their previous responsibilities and activities.


Recovery and relapse prevention 37

Planning appropriate goals and setting priorities are essential to
making this transition successful. Each plan and set of priorities
is individual. However, it is important to discuss your ideas and
concerns with your psychiatrist. Taking on too many or too few
responsibilities can have an impact on recovery. Sometimes, people
are advised to discuss their plans with other care providers, such
as an occupational therapist, social worker or psychologist. Family
members may also need to know about your plans and concerns.
Family can give important support and feedback as you resume
responsibilities. The aim is to get the “just right” type of challenge.
This is true whether people are returning to school or work, or tak-
ing on roles within their family and community.

SCHOOL

If you are planning to return to school, you should discuss this
with your psychiatrist and/or other mental health care provider.
Some people they need to resume studies on a part-time basis.
Many people experience problems with concentration and memory.
Look for ways to improve or adjust your study habits. Study for
shorter periods. Avoid noisy or high-traffic areas, as people often
find it hard to block out the surrounding sights and sounds.

Letting your teachers know about some of your difficulties may be
helpful. Many schools and most colleges and universities have a
“special needs” office that may also be helpful. A counsellor at this
office will ask about the reason for your absence. This information
will help the counsellors work with your teachers and instructors.
A counsellor can suggest the best change to a course load and res-
ponsibilities. Sometimes it may be helpful to give permission to
these counsellors to speak with your health care providers.


38

Bipolar disorder: An information guide

WORK

Returning to work may involve similar challenges and careful
planning. It is important to discuss your plans for work with your
psychiatrist. You may also need to discuss your concerns and plans
with an occupational therapist, who can give you additional advice
and support.

It is best to resume your responsibilities gradually, by starting either

part-time or with a smaller workload. Your health care provider may

recommend specific job accommodations to your work responsibili-

ties and schedule that may also be helpful in this transition. Typical

job accommodations include more frequent breaks, time off to attend
medical appointments, and a change in non-essential job duties.

Educating your employer and co-workers about some of the typical
signs of mood changes may be helpful in some cases. However,
some people prefer not to discuss their illness with their employer.
This choice will not allow you to ask for accommodations, but it
does not mean that you will be unsuccessful in your transition back
to work. In this situation it is especially important to have support
outside of work to discuss your problems and concerns.

HOME AND COMMUNITY RESPONSIBILITIES

You may also need to resume home and community duties gradu-
ally, in order to find the “just right” challenge of responsibilities and
involvements. Reviewing priorities and developing a plan to resume
activities may also be necessary. Look at what you can do and have
been doing, and plan accordingly.

What you are currently able to do may not match what you were
able to do in the past. Although this may be frustrating, set daily
goals and monitor your accomplishments. Reflecting on and modi-


Recovery and relapse prevention

fying your expectations is often an important part of this process. In
the early stages you may need to rely on family members to absorb
some of the daily household and other responsibilities. As recovery
continues, you can gradually resume your responsibilities.

Recognizing and responding to early
warning signs and triggers

When you return to school, work, or home and community involve-
ment, it is important to learn to recognize and respond to any subtle
changes in your mood. Focusing on ways to concentrate better and
to work more efficiently may also help. You may also benefit from.

decreasing some of the external stresses in your environment.

DEPRESSION

Typical signs of starting to feel depressed are:

+ trouble concentrating and focusing or completing tasks
+ lower energy level and confidence

+ sensitivity about the comments of others

+ increased worry

+ doubting the worth of daily involvement in activities

+ trouble making fairly simple decisions

+ changes in sleep and appetite.

It is also important to learn to identify your personal triggers, and
make plans to cope effectively when they arise. Triggers are external
events or circumstances that can precede mood changes. Some
examples are:

+ anniversary dates

+ financial problems

+ conflict with an important person
+ being in an abusive situation

+ physical illness, such as flu.

When you are depressed or are experiencing triggers, you may find
it helps to:

+ recognize some of the symptoms, and speak to your doctor to see
if your medications need to be adjusted or if other treatments may
be needed

+ seek out family members, friends or co-workers to support you
and realistically assess your impressions

+ focus on completing simpler, concrete tasks, and delay the harder
and more challenging tasks if possible

+ delay making any important decisions

+ limit time in more public and/or socially demanding activities

+ structure your day to include more activities that you find rewarding

+ set goals to address these mood changes; for example, make sure you
are involved in enjoyable activities with people who support you.

HYPOMANIA
Typical signs of starting to feel hypomanic are:
+ decreased need for sleep

+ higher energy level and confidence (often includes taking on
many tasks)


Recovery and relapse prevention

+ trouble settling down to work
+ strong feelings or disagreements (more than usual)
+ making decisions impulsively (more than usual).

‘When hypomanic, you may find it helps to:

+ recognize some of the symptoms, and speak to your doctor to
decide if your medications need to be adjusted or if other treat-
ments may be necessary

+ look for ways to make your physical environment less stimulating

+ consciously try to get enough sleep and to relax enough

+ look for ways to protect yourself against yourself, such as putting
away credit cards and avoiding certain social circles

+ consider putting off major decisions and cancelling any critical
meetings

+ plan your day and keep to a limited schedule

+ set goals to address these mood changes outside work; for exam-
ple, find how to work off your extra energy safely with hobbies,
exercise, etc.

CONCENTRATION

Whether you are feeling depressed or hypomanic, you may have
trouble concentrating. At these times, you should:

+ discuss your problems with your doctor

+ recognize that this will not last

+ try harder to write out goals and make plans for yourself

+ set goals that have flexible time limits

+ make your environment less stimulating

+ try to become aware of what times you perform best during the day.

What happens when someone you
love has bipolar disorder?

When a family member has a chronic illness, it affects your entire
family. This is true of a physical illness, such as diabetes, or a mental
illness, such as bipolar disorder. When your relative or partner has a
mental illness, you must cope with extra stressors, such as stigma.
Fearing prejudice, your family may try to deal with mental illness
alone. Furthermore, bipolar disorder will affect your relative’s mood
and behaviour. At times, your family member’s mood disorder can
make him or her less able to manage the illness, and the person
may become less able to work with you to solve problems. This may
include changes in how the person can attend to their usual roles
and responsibilities.

As a family member, you will likely find both the manic and de-
pressed phases of the illness very distressing. If your family mem-
ber has only mild mood swings, you may be able to get through
them without too much trouble. But if your relative’s mood swings
are severe, you will likely find them hard to handle.


Help for partners and families 43

Depression

Seeing a loved one struggle with depression can make people feel
sad, concerned, frightened, helpless and anxious. You may experi-
ence guilt, anger and frustration. All depressive episodes are upset-
ting, but the first episode will probably be especially confusing. You
may not understand what is happening and why the person is not
getting better on his or her own. Without information about depres-
sion, you might assume that your relative is lazy, or give well-mean-
ing advice and become frustrated and annoyed when he or she does
not act on it. If your relative talks about suicide, you will understand-
ably live with a great deal of worry.

HOW TO RELATE TO A PERSON WHO IS DEPRESSED

Family members often do not know how to talk to a person who is
depressed. They may be afraid to ask too many questions and inad-
vertently upset their loved one. At the same time, they do not want
the ill person to feel that they are not interested or are avoiding him
or her.

Try to be as supportive, understanding and patient as possible. Just
recognizing that depression is an illness can help your relative to
feel less guilty about his or her impaired functioning.

TIPS FOR COMMUNICATING WITH A PERSON
WHO IS DEPRESSED

1. Speak in a calm quiet voice.

2. Focus on one subject at a time. Your relative or friend may have
trouble concentrating.


44

Bipolar disorder: An information guide

3. If the person is quiet and withdrawn, break the ice with neutral,
non-threatening statements, such as “It seems a bit warm in here.”

4.Be patient and wait. It may take a while for your loved to respond.

5- Your ability to listen is a valuable resource to your relative.
Depression causes people to talk a lot about how bad they feel,
yet they may not be ready to discuss solutions to their problems.
Listening and letting the person know, in a neutral manner, that
you have heard what he or she has said is valuable and support-
ive. You do not have to offer immediate solutions.

6.If the person is irritable, you probably need to slow down, adjust
your expectations and use a very neutral approach. Neutral com-
ments about the weather, what you are making for dinner or other
routine subjects are the safest way to develop a dialogue. Listen for
opportunities to acknowledge or add to your relative’s responses.
At these times, conversations about important decisions or issues
are unlikely to be productive. You may need to plan to discuss
important issues at a later date.

7. Avoid quizzing people about what made them feel depressed. Do
not blame them for the way they feel, or tell them to snap out of
it. People who are moderately depressed may be able to hear your
helpful suggestions, but be unable to act on your advice. Quizzing
or blaming them will only reinforce their guilt, loneliness and iso-
lation. Often, people with depression cannot identify what made
them depressed or what will be helpful.

8. Pace yourself. If your relative is severely or more chronically
depressed, it is normal for you to find his or her company very
draining. Brief, frequent contacts are often the best way to relate
to someone with severe depression. If your relative is hospitalized,
family members might take turns in visiting.


Help for partners and families 45

Mania

How a person behaves during a manic episode stirs up intense
feelings, especially family members. You may feel frustrated,
annoyed, angry or even hatred. The strength of your feelings will
depend on how severe the episode is. It is particularly frightening
if, in a manic episode, the family member you know seems to
be replaced by a stranger. For example, a reserved, responsible
person can become loud and sexually free; a kind, gentle person
can become bossy and cruel.

As well, people experiencing mania usually think that they are right
and everyone else is wrong. This aspect of mania is challenging for
relatives and others around the person. Your family member may
take no responsibility for what he or she says or does. As a result,
there may be times when you have to bail the person out. Moreover,
your relative may be acutely sensitive to weaknesses in others and
can behave in ways that embarrass them. A person with severe
mania can easily “blow up,” and being with someone in this state
has been compared to walking in a minefield—you never know
when there will be an explosion. Hardest of all, when someone is
experiencing mania, he or she may have no insight into the manic
behaviour.

If your partner has a manic episode, you may find it particularly
hard because you, more than anyone, may be the target of his or
her anger. You may also become a “buffer” between the person and
the community, as others demand that he or she be controlled. If
your partner runs up large bills, you may be hounded by creditors.
Some people experiencing severe mania have extramarital affairs,
which they may flaunt. If this happens, you may feel humiliated
and betrayed.


46

Bipolar disorder: An information guide

Withdrawing from your partner and considering divorce may seem
the only way out of an intolerable situation. But you should not
make big decisions, such as whether or not to divorce, when the
person is severely ill. The situation will probably change when he
or she has recovered.

HOW TO RESPOND TO A PERSON EXPERIENCING
MANIA

Early in a manic episode, a person may be overly happy, energetic
and outgoing. Those around the person can easily be caught up in
the high spirits. Stay realistic and do not get carried away by this
high mood. A person experiencing mania feeds on attention and
conflict. Try to discourage the person from becoming involved in
stimulating situations, such as long talks and parties.

Only a small percentage of people with bipolar disorder experience
severe mania. A person with severe mania may become hostile and
suspicious, or may explode verbally and physically. Avoid arguing
with someone in this state. The person will only become angrier
and may even assault you.

Typically, in a manic episode, people may behave without being
aware of or considering the dangers to themselves and others. They
may take on risky business ventures, overspend, drive recklessly,
etc. You may need to step in. The best way of preventing this kind
of behaviour is to plan for it when your relative is well. During stable
periods, discuss and set rules that may involve safeguards. For
example, consider withholding credit cards, banking privileges and
car keys. Hospitalization can save the life of a person experienc-
ing mania.


Help for partners and families 47

TIPS FOR COMMUNICATING WITH A PERSON
EXPERIENCING MANIA

1. Reduce stimulation. People with mania are easily overstimulated.
You may need to have fewer people visit at the same time. Or you
may need to reduce noise and activity in the house.

2. Keep conversations brief.

3. Deal only with immediate issues. Do not try to reason or argue.

4. Discourage discussing feelings.

5. Try not to be authoritative, but be firm, practical and realistic.

6.Do not jump to the person’s demands.

7. Do not get caught up with the person’s euphoria or unrealistic
expectations.

8. Do not try to convince the person that his or her plans are unreal-
istic. At the same time, take steps to ensure his or her safety (e.g.,
by removing car keys or credit cards).

Getting treatment for your family
member

FOLLOWING THROUGH WITH TREATMENT

Some people are very relieved when they are finally diagnosed and
receive treatment that stabilizes their moods. For others, however, it
is a long and bumpy road to accepting that they have a disorder that


48

Bipolar disorder: An information guide

must be managed over their lifespan. Some people must endure
several manic or depressive episodes before they consistently accept
help from doctors and therapists. Mild mania can be seductive
because it often includes feeling happy, more confident, more
energetic and more creative. The lure of these feelings may keep
some people from taking their medication.

As a family member, it can be very difficult to watch this process
without trying repeatedly to convince your relative to “take your
medication” or “go and talk to your doctor.” Repeated attempts to
convince and coax can lead to heated arguments and power strug-
gles. If you are very close to the person with bipolar disorder, and
yet you feel that he or she may not be open to your observation
that something is wrong, it may be more effective to have another
trusted person approach your relative.

SUICIDAL THOUGHTS

A person with moderate depression will probably agree to medical
treatment without needing too much encouragement. However, a
person who is severely depressed and suicidal may refuse treatment
because he or she feels so hopeless and worthless. In this case, you
or another trusted person should insist that the person see his or her
doctor or go to the emergency department of a local hospital.

Many people will agree to go to the hospital. If the person refuses,
there are a number of options the family can take. For example,

you can go to a justice of the peace to get an order allowing police
to take the person to hospital for an assessment. If there is an im-
mediate risk of suicide, you should call 911.

Involving the police is a painful and difficult decision, although it is
sometimes necessary in order to get an ill person to hospital. Family


Help for partners and families 49

members often feel overwhelmingly guilty about this decision. It is
important to remember that when people threaten suicide, they are
usually making a plea for help, which should be taken seriously. Sui-
cidal thinking is usually a temporary emotional state during which a
person needs to be in a place of safety.

MANIC EPISODES

You may see that your family member is developing hypomania
(e.g., being more energetic than usual, sleeping less, talking a lot).
If so, encourage the person to see a doctor at once to get medica-
tion that will help calm down and stabilize his or her mood. For
some people, hypomania leads to mania. If they are treated when
they are hypomanic, they may avoid a full-blown manic episode.
Once your family member develops full mania, the person may
be unable to see that he or she is ill, and so may refuse to see a
doctor. Manic episodes can make a person behave dangerously, with
potentially serious consequences. People experiencing mania are
therefore best treated in hospital.

YOUR FAMILY MEMBER IN HOSPITAL

Once in hospital, if your relative is quite ill and impaired, it is some-
times better for both the patient and the family if visits are frequent
but short. People who are acutely ill do not benefit from long conver-
sations in which they can become overwhelmed as they ruminate,
or repeatedly focus on their feelings of hopelessness and negativity.
Frequent, brief contacts allow you to stay in touch with your relative,
and reassure him or her that you remain supportive.

For some people, being in hospital is very challenging because their
movements may be restricted to ensure safety. They may wish to
leave the hospital before the professional staff feel their mood and


50

Bipolar disorder: An information guide

behaviour are stabilized. For family members, this is particularly
difficult as they can foresee the problems at home if the person be-
comes acutely ill again and requires hospitalization. Some patients
will respond to the concerns of friends and family and agree to stay
longer in hospital. This is more easily accomplished if there are clear
goals to be achieved during the admission. For example, it might
be helpful to concretely state that the person must be stabilized on
medication and connected with a day program or community thera-
pist before discharge.

Most jurisdictions in North America have mental health legisla-
tion that permits involuntary hospitalization of people only if they
threaten to harm themselves or other people, or cannot care for
themselves. Many ill people who would benefit from hospitaliza-
tion do not meet these criteria and therefore may refuse to enter
the hospital, or leave the hospital against medical advice. Families
usually have a very hard time living with a person with mania
who refuses treatment and who cannot be legally hospitalized or
kept in hospital.

In these situations, try to negotiate with your relative when it might
be best to leave the hospital. What must be accomplished during the
admission for you to feel it is safe for the person to return home?
Could these issues be discussed in a discharge planning meeting
with your relative, the doctor and any other care providers who work
with him or her?

Sometimes, you can slow your relative down by saying that you need
this meeting to take place before consenting to his or her returning
home. Families often feel guilty at insisting on these conditions,
because they worry that their loved one will feel rejected. However, the
result of premature discharge and poor discharge planning is fre-
quently a relapse in the illness and a more complicated situation.


Help for partners and families

Care for partners and families

When someone has a serious illness, it is natural for family members
to feel worried and stressed. In an effort to spend time comforting
or helping their loved one, family members may give up their own
activities. Unsure of how others may respond to their ill partner or
relative, they may also avoid having friends visit their home. Over
time, they may become isolated from their own network of friends,
or find that most of their own routines and activities have been
replaced by the demands of caring for their loved one. Often, they
are well into this situation before they realize how emotionally and
physically drained they have become. This stress can lead to sleep
disturbances, exhaustion or chronic irritability.

It is important to recognize these signs of stress in yourself and look
after your own physical and mental health. Recognizing your own
limitations and making time for yourself are key elements in “self-
care.” Ensure that you have a good support system of reliable friends
and relatives. Think about whom you want to share the details of the
situation with. Mental illness is a difficult thing for some people to
make sense of, so it is understandable if you want to be selective and
choose only people who you know will be supportive.

Families and partners need to get as much information as possible
about bipolar disorder. Knowledge and understanding will improve
your ability to help and support your loved one, deal with your
own feelings, and explain the situation to extended family, friends
and colleagues. Information is available from the treating doctor,
social worker or other mental health care providers. In addition
to this publication, there are numerous books written for people
with bipolar disorder and their families. They are usually available
through public libraries.


52

Bipolar disorder: An information guide

Consider getting professional support for yourself, and joining

a peer-support group or family support program, which may be
offered at a local hospital or community mental health clinic. Keep
up your interests outside the family and apart from your ill relative.
Acknowledge and accept that sometimes you will have negative
feelings about the situation. These feelings are normal and should
not be a source of guilt.

Being ready for a relapse or crisis

Families often avoid talking to their relative about relapses or crises.
They fear that talking about a crisis will bring one on, or they simply
do not want to upset their relative. However, the best way to handle
a crisis is to know what to do before it happens. It is important to
focus on maintaining wellness, but some planning for a possible
crisis can create a sense of security for the ill person and the family.

When your family member is well, discuss what you will do if he
or she should become ill again. Is it possible to visit your relative’s
doctor together to discuss his or her condition and the possibility of
a crisis? If your relative became ill, would you have permission to
contact his or her doctor? Would you have consent to take the person
to the hospital, and which hospital is preferred? If your loved one
were acutely ill, would you be allowed to make decisions? Could you
put the conditions of an agreement in writing to ensure that these
instructions were followed? A prearranged plan and a good work-
ing relationship with your relative’s doctor can help to contain an
emergency situation.

Tips for helping your family member
and supporting recovery

1. Learn as much as you can about bipolar disorder. Learning about
the causes, signs and symptoms, and treatment of bipolar disor-
der will help you to understand and support your family member
in his or her recovery.

2. Acknowledge and accept your own feelings. Having conflicting
emotions is normal when a loved one is diagnosed with bipolar
disorder. Knowing this can help you control these emotions when
you want to support your relative in making steps toward recov-
ery. For example, you may feel sad that your family member has
a mental illness, and angry at what has happened and its effect
on you. You may fear what the future holds and worry about how
you will cope. If you are a parent, you may feel that somehow you
caused the bipolar disorder, even though doctors have told you
otherwise. It is also normal to feel a deep sense of loss when your
relative is behaving in troubling, unfamiliar ways. And you may
feel burdened by the extra tasks you have to take on.

Encourage your family member to follow the prescribed treat-
ment. If your relative is not showing improvement or is having
uncomfortable side-effects, encourage him or her to speak to
the doctor about the medication, or to get a second opinion. It is
helpful if you can go with your relative to the doctor and share
what you have observed.

4.Learn the warning signs of suicide. These signs include your
relative showing increasing despair, winding up his or her affairs
and talking about “When I’m gone... .” Take any threats very
seriously and get help immediately. Call 911 if the situation gets
desperate. Recognize, and help your family member to see, that


Bipolar disorder: An information guide

suicidal thinking is a symptom of the illness. Always stress how
much you value the person's life.

5. When your family member is well, plan how to try to avoid
crises. Plan together how you will respond to periods of acute
illness, including dealing with suicidal behaviour and prevent-
ing harmful results of manic behaviour, such as overspending
or reckless driving.

6.Remember your own needs. Try to:

+ take care of yourself

+ keep up your own support network

+ avoid isolating yourself

+ acknowledge, within your family, the stresses of coping with
bipolar disorder

+ share the responsibility with others

+ stop bipolar disorder from taking over family life.

7. Recognize that recovery from a manic or depressive episode is
slow and gradual. Know that your family member needs to recover
at his or her own pace. Try not to expect too much but avoid being
overprotective. Remember that stabilizing mood is the first step
towards a return to normal functioning. Try to do things with your
relative rather than for him or her. That way, your relative will
gradually regain self-confidence.

8. View bipolar disorder as an illness, not a character flaw. Treat
your relative normally once he or she has recovered. At the
same time, watch for possible signs of recurrence. In a caring
way, point out any early symptoms and suggest a talk with the
person's doctor.


Help for partners and families

g.Learn, with your family member, to distinguish a good day from
hypomania and a bad day from depression. Like everybody else,
people with bipolar disorder have good and bad days that are not
part of their illness.

8 Explaining b
hildren

i
to chi

Explaining bipolar disorder or other mental illness to children can

be awkward and difficult. To protect their children, the parent with
bipolar disorder and the well parent (if present) may choose to say

nothing and try to continue with family routines as if nothing were
wrong. While this may provide a short-term solution, over the long
term it can leave children confused and worried about the changes
in behaviour that they have inevitably noticed.

Children are sensitive and intuitive, and quickly notice when some-
one in the family has changed. If the atmosphere in the family sug-
gests that the subject should not be discussed, children will draw
their own, often incorrect, conclusions. Young children, especially
those of pre-school or elementary school age, often see the world as
revolving around themselves. If something negative or unpleasant
happens, they assume they did something to cause it. For example,
if a child disobeys a parent and gets into trouble, and the next
morning the parent is depressed, the child may assume that he or
she caused the parent’s depression.

To explain mental illness and bipolar disorder to children, you
provide them with them as much information as they are mature
enough to understand. Toddlers and pre-school children are able


Explaining bipolar disorder to children 57

to understand simple, short sentences, without much technical
information. School-age children can process more information,
but may be overwhelmed by details about medications and thera-
pies. Teenagers are generally able to manage most information,
and often need to talk about their impressions and feelings. They
may have questions about how open they should be about the situ-
ation, and concerns about the stigma of mental illness. Sharing
information with them provides an opening for further discussion.

It is helpful to cover three main areas:

1. The parent or other family member behaves this way because he
or she is sick. It is important to tell children that the family mem-
ber is ill with a sickness called bipolar disorder. Bipolar disorder
makes people feel one of two ways. They might be very depressed,
or sad, sometimes for no reason. They might cry a lot, sleep all day
and have trouble eating or talking to people. At other times, they
might become very loud and happy, although small things might
irritate them and make them angry.

b

. Reassure the child that he or she did not cause the family mem-
ber’s illness. Children need to be reassured that they did not cause
their loved one’s changes in mood through something they did or
did not do. This is a frequent assumption that children will feel
guilty about. Bipolar disorder needs to be explained as an illness,
just like having chicken pox or a bad cold.

we

. Reassure the child that the adults in the family and other people,
such as doctors, are trying to help the person who has bipolar
disorder. Looking after the person is an adult responsibility, and
not something the child should worry about. Children need the
well parent, or other trusted adults, to serve as a buffer against the
effects of a parent’s symptoms of depression and mania. They may
find it very helpful to talk about their feelings with someone who


58

Bipolar disorder: An information guide

empathizes with how hard it is to see their mother, father or other
relative suffering. Many children are frightened by the changes in
their parent. They miss the time previously spent with this parent.
Participation in activities outside the home is helpful because it
exposes children to other healthy relationships. As the ill parent
recovers, gradually resuming family activities can help restore the
relationship between the children and the ill parent.

Both the ill and the well parent should talk with the children about
explaining the illness to people outside the family. Support from
friends is important for everyone; however, bipolar disorder can
be difficult to explain, and some families are concerned about the
stigma attached to mental illness. The level of openness you and
your children are comfortable with is a very individual choice.

Some parents with bipolar disorder may not be able to tolerate the
boisterous activities and noise that are part of children’s everyday
play and routines. It may be necessary to take special measures to
protect against events that could trigger irritability in the ill parent
and cause him or her to be abrupt with the children. You may need
to plan time for the children to play outside the home, or arrange for
the ill parent to rest for part of the day in a quiet area of the house.

Once recovered, it is helpful for the parent who was ill to explain his
or her behaviour to the children. The recovered parent may need to
plan some special times with the children, to re-establish the rela-
tionship and to reassure the children that he or she is again available
and interested in them.

able in the pamphlet When a Parent Has Bipolar Disorder... What
Kids Want to Know, available from the Centre for Addiction and
Mental Health. An online version is available at www.camh.ca.

Bipolar disorder is a serious medical condition in which people
have extreme mood swings that affect how they think, behave
and function. It typically includes a high state (mania) and a low
state (depression)—both of which can include many different
symptoms—in addition to a well state.

This guide is for people living with bipolar disorder, their families
and anyone else who wants to understand this disorder. The guide
describes the clinical features and symptoms of bipolar disorder,
what is thought to cause it, and how it can be managed and treated.
It also includes ways family members can support people with
bipolar disorder while also taking care of themselves, and tips on
explaining the disorder to children.
